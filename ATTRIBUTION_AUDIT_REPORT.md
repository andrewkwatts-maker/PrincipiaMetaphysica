## AI Attribution Policy

All three AI tools that assisted in development are credited equally:

- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Primary development assistant
- **Grok (xAI)** - Development assistant
- **Gemini (Google)** - Development assistant

**Important:** These tools are credited as **development assistants**, not authors or co-authors. They have **no intellectual property rights** to the theory, code, or documentation.

## Git Commit History

### Note on Past Commits

Some previous git commits contain the following language:
- "🤖 Generated with Claude Code (https://claude.com/claude-code)"
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

**Clarification:** These commit messages were automatically generated by development tools and **do not imply shared ownership**. All intellectual property belongs exclusively to Andrew Keith Watts. The AI tools mentioned are development assistants only.

Git commit history is immutable without rewriting repository history (which would break all forks and clones), so these messages remain in the commit log but are superseded by:

1. The copyright headers in all current files
2. This attribution audit report
3. The explicit ownership statement in all footers

## Framework Updates

During this audit, we also updated outdated framework references:

- Removed all "14D×2" references
- Updated to correct framework: **26D (24,2) → Sp(2,R) gauge fixing → 13D (12,1) → G₂ compactification → 6D (5,1) → 4D (3,1)**
- Updated `solutions/time-circularity-section.html` to reflect current framework

Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this code, in whole or in part, without the express written permission of Andrew Keith Watts is strictly prohibited.

## Verification

To verify attribution compliance, run:

```bash
python fix_attribution.py
```

This script checks:
- ✅ Copyright headers in all HTML files
- ✅ Copyright headers in all Python files
- ✅ Footer attribution mentioning all three AI tools equally
- ✅ No "Generated with" or "Co-Authored-By" language in file content
- ✅ Andrew K Watts ownership explicitly stated

## Conclusion

**All intellectual property in the Principia Metaphysica repository is owned exclusively by Andrew Keith Watts.**

AI tools (Claude, Grok, and Gemini) are credited as development assistants and have no ownership rights to the theory, framework, code, or documentation.
