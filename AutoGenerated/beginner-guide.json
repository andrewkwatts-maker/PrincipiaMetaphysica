      "title": "Kaluza-Klein Gravitons: Echoes from Extra Dimensions",
      "simpleExplanation": "When gravity propagates through the 7 extra dimensions, it creates 'echoes' called Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons. These are heavier cousins of the ordinary graviton, with masses around 13-17 TeV. If we smash particles together at high enough energy (like at the LHC), we might create these KK gravitons, which would appear as missing energy in the detector—a smoking gun for extra dimensions.",

        "title": "The Organ Pipe Analogy",
        "description": "Imagine blowing air through an organ pipe. The fundamental tone is the lowest frequency (ordinary graviton, massless), but the pipe also resonates at higher harmonics (overtones). These overtones are the KK gravitons—higher-energy modes of the gravitational field vibrating in the extra dimensions. Longer pipes (larger extra dimensions) have lower overtones; shorter pipes (smaller dimensions) have higher overtones.",

        ]
      },
      "keyTakeaway": "KK gravitons are testable! If the LHC (or future colliders) detect an excess of events with large missing transverse energy at 13-17 TeV, it would be direct evidence for extra dimensions. PM predicts a 5σ discovery at the High-Luminosity LHC by 2030.",
      "technicalDetail": "KK graviton masses are set by the G₂ compactification scale: m_KK^(n) = n/R_G₂, where R_G₂ ~ M_GUT⁻¹ ≈ 10⁻³¹ m. The first KK mode has m_KK^(1) ≈ 13-17 TeV. Production cross-section at √s = 14 TeV: σ(pp → G_KK → invisible) ~ 0.1-0.5 fb. Signature: large missing E_T + jet. HL-LHC (3000 fb⁻¹) can probe up to 20 TeV.",
