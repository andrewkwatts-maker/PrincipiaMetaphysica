  "formula": "r_s \u2192 163 bulk",
  "verification_status": "NOT_TESTABLE",
  "reason": "Schwarzschild quantization requires quantum gravity theory. The claim that black hole formation shifts matter to '163 hidden bulk' is not derivable from PM topology alone - it requires experimental quantum gravity data that does not exist.",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: Density limit \u2192 163 hidden collapse. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
