  "reason": "Decoherence threshold is QM axiom (Copenhagen/decoherence interpretation boundary). The quantum-to-classical transition is foundational to QM, not a PM-specific prediction. PM uses standard decoherence theory as input. quantum_decoherence_solver.py calculates coherence times for Orch-OR but does not verify G55.",

  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: Hidden->Active observation boundary. v22.0-12PAIR: Decoherence rate scales with environmental entanglement across 12x(2,0) bridges. Orch-OR coherence time: tau = h/(E_G * N_tubulin). Cross-shadow decoherence suppressed by bridge geometry. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
