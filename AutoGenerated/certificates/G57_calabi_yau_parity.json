  "verification_status": "NOT_TESTABLE",
  "reason": "Calabi-Yau parity h^{2,1}=3 is a structural assumption about extra dimensions. Hodge numbers of compactified dimensions cannot be experimentally measured. PM derives 3 generations from b3=24, but the CY topology itself is a framework input. No experiment can measure the Hodge diamond of hidden dimensions.",
  "chi_eff_usage": "Implicit: n_gen = chi_eff/24 = 72/24 = 3 (per-shadow)",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: Internal holes = 3 generations. v22.0-12PAIR: The G2 manifold has chi_eff = 72 per shadow, giving n_gen = chi_eff/24 = 3 via index theorem. Alternative: n_gen = chi_eff_total/48 = 144/48 = 3. Both derivations yield 3 generations from the 12x(2,0) bridge architecture. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
