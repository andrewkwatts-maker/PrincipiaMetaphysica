  "reason": "Calabi-Yau parity h^{2,1}=3 is a structural assumption about extra dimensions. Hodge numbers of compactified dimensions cannot be experimentally measured. PM derives 3 generations from b3=24, but the CY topology itself is a framework input. No experiment can measure the Hodge diamond of hidden dimensions.",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: Internal holes = 3 generations. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
