  "verification_status": "NOT_TESTABLE",
  "reason": "Brane-world boundary (matter confined to 4D brane) is a Randall-Sundrum-type assumption. While brane-world models have testable consequences (KK gravitons at G56), the confinement axiom itself is an input, not a PM derivation. brane_diagrams.py is a visualization, not a derivation.",
  "chi_eff_usage": "None (topological assumption: visible_sector = 125 = 5^3)",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: 125 matter trapped on 4D brane. v22.0-12PAIR: The visible sector (125 = 5^3) contains SM parameters localized on one 4D brane within each (11,1) shadow. The 12x(2,0) Euclidean bridges connect the two shadows but do not carry SM matter. Only gravity and sterile neutrinos propagate in the bulk. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
