  "reason": "Holographic bound S<=A/(4G) is Bekenstein-Hawking physics (1970s-1990s), not PM-derived. PM uses this bound as input to derive Lambda, not as an output.",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: S <= A/4 for any volume. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction. v22: Holographic principle consistent with 288-root boundary/bulk partition.",
