  "reason": "Topological soliton stability (pi_3(S^2)->125 knots) is a framework consistency constraint. The 125 value comes from visible_sector partition (5^3=125), not derived from homotopy theory. Verifying cosmic string/domain wall/monopole soliton stability requires cosmological observations of topological defects which are not currently accessible. Gate validation only checks active==125, not actual soliton physics.",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: Only 125 knots stable. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
