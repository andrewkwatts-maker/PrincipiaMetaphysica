  "reason": "Spectral gap verification is redundant with G18 (Mass-Gap Quantization). G18 establishes the mathematical theorem that Dm >= 1/288 from the 288-root structure. G70's 'no ghost nodes' check is the same constraint restated - the discrete eigenvalue spectrum with gaps > 0 is already guaranteed by G18's theorem. Current implementation just returns True unconditionally without actual eigenvalue computation.",
  "note": "FOUNDATIONAL: No ghost nodes between 125. This is a framework assumption, not an empirical prediction.",
