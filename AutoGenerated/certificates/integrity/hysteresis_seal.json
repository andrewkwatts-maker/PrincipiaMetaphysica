  "theoretical_significance": "The symplectic structure ω of phase space is preserved under Hamiltonian evolution. This ensures that the 125 geometric residues are path-independent: the value of any physical observable does not depend on the computational or historical path taken to calculate it. This 'hysteresis seal' guarantees that the theory is time-reversible at the fundamental level, and that residue calculations are reproducible regardless of the order of operations.",
