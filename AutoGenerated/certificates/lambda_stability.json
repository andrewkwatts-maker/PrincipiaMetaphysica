  "theoretical_significance": "The cosmological constant problem (the 10^120 discrepancy between quantum field theory predictions and observed dark energy) is resolved by symplectic screening. In the G₂ manifold framework, the 3-form flux b₃ = 24 and Chern-Simons level k = 24 are quantized integers, not floating-point estimates. This quantization 'freezes' the running of Λ at laboratory energy scales. The screening factor β(Λ) = (b₃² × k²)^-4 = (576 × 576)^-4 ≈ 10^-50 represents a hard theoretical floor, far below any experimental detection limit (~10^-20). This is not fine-tuning; it is topological necessity.",
