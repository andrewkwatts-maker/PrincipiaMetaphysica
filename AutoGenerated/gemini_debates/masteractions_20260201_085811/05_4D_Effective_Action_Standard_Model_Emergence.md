**Priority:** HIGHEST
**Targets:** simulations/PM/derivations/lagrangian_master.py, simulations/PM/gauge/master_action.py, simulations/PM/derivations/gauge_sector_complete.py

**VERDICT:** MODIFY
**CONFIDENCE:** MEDIUM
**SCIENTIFIC_SCORE:** 7

**STRENGTHS:**
- Provides a clear and concise overview of the 4D effective action expected to emerge from the Principia Metaphysica framework.
- Explicitly lists the terms in the Lagrangian, including gravity, chiral fermions, Higgs, gauge fields, Yukawa couplings, strong CP term, cosmological constant, dark matter portal, and residue corrections.
- Highlights the geometric origin of all parameters, emphasizing the absence of free parameters beyond the spectral residues.
- Addresses the mirror shadow and its chirality-flipped structure, which is a testable prediction.

**WEAKNESSES:**
- The "derivation" is symbolic and does not provide concrete calculations or explicit mappings from the 27D bulk to the 4D effective action. It's more of a summary of expected features.
- The values given for some parameters (e.g., Lambda ~ 10^{-52} m^{-2}, alpha_leak ~ 0.57) lack detailed derivations within this proposal and rely on other parts of the framework. The alpha_leak value is particularly suspect, given the context.
- The statement about theta ~ 0 relies on axion misalignment or moduli stabilization, but the specific mechanism and parameter values are not provided here.
- The claim that all parameters are geometrically derived from the 27D bulk action needs more explicit demonstration. The connection between the 125 spectral residues and the Standard Model parameters needs to be clarified.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
The proposal should be modified to include more explicit derivations and connections to the existing framework. Specifically, the derivation of alpha_leak and the cosmological constant should be detailed. The connection between the 125 spectral residues and the Standard Model parameters should be clarified.

**SPECIFIC_ACTIONS:**
- **MODIFY:** Add cross-references to the specific simulations and formulas that derive the values of Lambda and alpha_leak. If alpha_leak is simply 1/sqrt(6), then explicitly state this and justify its geometric origin.
- **MODIFY:** Include a section outlining how the 125 spectral residues map to the Standard Model parameters (couplings, masses, mixing angles). This could be a high-level overview, but it needs to be more concrete than "small quantum corrections."
- **ADD:** Include a subsection detailing the axion misalignment or moduli stabilization mechanism that leads to theta ~ 0. Provide specific parameter values or ranges that are consistent with experimental bounds.
- **ADD:** Create a new simulation that explicitly calculates the cosmological constant based on the formula provided, linking it to the volume of the G2 manifold and the flux integral.
- **REJECT:** The claim that *all* parameters are geometrically derived is too strong. Acknowledge that some parameters may require further refinement or higher-order corrections.
