**Priority:** HIGH
**Targets:** simulations/PM/paper/sections/predictions.py, simulations/PM/cosmology/gw_dispersion.py, simulations/PM/paper/sections/discussion.py

**VERDICT:** ADOPT
**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH
**SCIENTIFIC_SCORE:** 9

**STRENGTHS:**
- Provides a comprehensive overview of experimental tests for the theory, making it falsifiable.
- Connects theoretical predictions to specific experimental setups (ADMX, IAXO, DUNE, CMB-S4, DESI, LIGO/Virgo, etc.).
- Quantifies the predicted parameter ranges and compares them with current and projected experimental sensitivities.
- Offers clear falsification criteria, outlining what experimental results would support or refute the theory.
- Does not introduce new free parameters or break existing derivations.
- Focuses on testable predictions and experimental validation, which is crucial for the scientific method.

**WEAKNESSES:**
- Relies on existing experimental designs and sensitivities, which are subject to change.
- The specific numerical values for predictions are not derived within this proposal itself, but rather referenced from other parts of the framework. It would be beneficial to have a more direct link to the underlying equations.
- The "Falsifiability Summary" could be more precise in stating the required adjustments to the theory if certain experimental results are obtained.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Adopt this proposal as it provides a crucial bridge between the theoretical framework and experimental verification. Ensure that the predicted parameter values are consistently updated as the framework evolves and that the falsification criteria are clearly defined and linked to the underlying equations.

**SPECIFIC_ACTIONS:**
- Add a new section in the documentation outlining the experimental tests and falsification criteria.
- Create a table summarizing the predicted parameter ranges and corresponding experimental sensitivities.
- Include links to the relevant experimental papers and websites.
- Add unit tests that check if the predicted parameter values are within the reach of current or near-future experiments.
- Add a section in the documentation that explains how the theory would be modified if certain experimental results are obtained.
