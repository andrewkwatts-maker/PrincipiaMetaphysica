The stated number of derivation steps suggests a rigorous underlying process. Concepts like 'alpha-leak-coupling' and 'racetrack-moduli-vev' are standard in relevant theoretical physics. However, some descriptions, particularly for the OR operators and warping potentials, use highly abstract terminology ('creates dual shadows', 'Dirac eigenvalue modulation', 'God-level limit', 'Human-level limit') without immediate contextual elaboration, which might hinder quick understanding for those less immersed in the PM framework's specific lexicon.",

Values referenced in certificates (e.g., `alpha_leak`, `shadow_asymmetry_delta_T`) precisely match calculated values and parameter definitions. The number of faces (`geometry.n_faces = 4`) aligns with the Hodge number mentioned in the section content and the four distinct Kahler moduli. Formulas directly relate to and explain the parameters.
