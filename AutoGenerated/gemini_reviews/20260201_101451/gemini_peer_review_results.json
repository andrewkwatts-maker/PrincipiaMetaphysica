All are categorized as 'PREDICTED', which aligns with a theoretical framework. However, the lack of explicit mathematical forms in the description makes it difficult to fully assess their unique strength or elegance.",

This suggests a high-level summary rather than detailed rigor, potentially obscuring the complexity and robustness of the actual derivations. More explicit detail on the derivation process would enhance confidence.",

The precise match of the total DM relic density with Planck 2018 results is a significant success, and the predicted cross-section being robustly below XENONnT bounds is crucial. The perturbativity check for the coupling further strengthens the theoretical consistency.",
