This framework realizes a dual-shadow structure, where a unified time eliminates ghosts/CTCs, and a shared C<sup>(2,0)</sup> Euclidean central bridge (ds² = dy₁² + dy₂²) enables coherent interactions. Central to our approach is the compactification with G2 holonomy, from which we derive the fine structure constant α⁻¹ and precisely three fermion generations. The framework further yields 125 Standard Model parameters, including the Higgs mass from brane partition functions and the dark energy equation of state w₀ = -23/24, providing a comprehensive, geometrically-rooted explanation for fundamental physics.\"",
