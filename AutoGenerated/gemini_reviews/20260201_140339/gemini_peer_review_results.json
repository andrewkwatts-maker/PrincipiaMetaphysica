However, the inclusion of references like 'Shadows of the Mind' and 'Consciousness in the universe' (Penrose/Hameroff) in a 'unified physics framework' deriving Standard Model parameters is highly unusual and raises questions about the scope and potential for speculative content beyond mainstream physics, impacting its perceived scientific standing in a purely physics context.",
