The 13D observable shadow yields w₀ = -1 + 1/b₃ = -23/24 via MEP, and n_gen = 3 from G₂ flux-dressed topology χ_eff/48 = 144/48 = 3. With v15.0, the dynamic derivation of the Cabibbo angle ε = 0.2257 from racetrack moduli stabilization, coupled with full 7D Monte Carlo integration and active perturbation tests of geometric consistency, completes the phenomenological loop. The framework makes sharp, falsifiable predictions that will be tested by JUNO, DESI DR3, and Hyper-K in the coming years."

The 13D observable shadow yields w₀ = -1 + 1/b₃ = -23/24 via MEP, and n_gen = 3 from G₂ flux-dressed topology χ_eff/48 = 144/48 = 3. With v15.0, the dynamic derivation of the Cabibbo angle ε = 0.2257 from racetrack moduli stabilization, coupled with full 7D Monte Carlo integration and active perturbation tests of geometric consistency, completes the phenomenological loop. The framework makes sharp, falsifiable predictions that will be tested by JUNO, DESI DR3, and Hyper-K in the coming years."
