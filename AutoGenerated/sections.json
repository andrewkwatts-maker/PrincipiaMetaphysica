With v15.0, the dynamic derivation of the Cabibbo angle ε = 0.2257 from racetrack moduli stabilization, coupled with full 7D Monte Carlo integration and active perturbation tests of geometric consistency, completes the phenomenological loop.

While standard quantum mechanics predicts CHSH = 2√2 ≈ 2.828, the orthogonal time allows for advanced-wave correlations that slightly exceed this Tsirelson bound. Modified CHSH Prediction: CHSH = 2√2 × (1 + δ_ortho), where δ_ortho ~ ε_Z₂ × (Δt_ortho / τ_coh) ~ 10⁻⁵. This predicts CHSH ≈ 2.828 × (1 + 10⁻⁵) ≈ 2.828028, a violation of the Tsirelson bound at the ~10⁻⁵ level. While tiny, this is testable in delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments with sufficient statistics."
