  "beginnerSummary": "This introduction explores how physics has progressively unified seemingly different forces—from Maxwell's unification of electricity and magnetism to modern attempts at Grand Unified Theories. Principia Metaphysica proposes a radical approach: instead of assuming extra dimensions exist, it derives geometry from a fundamental fermionic field called the Pneuma field. The theory lives in 26 dimensions with two time directions, which project down to a 13-dimensional 'shadow' that further compactifies to our observable 4D universe. This framework uniquely determines many fundamental constants and makes precise predictions about dark energy and particle physics.",
