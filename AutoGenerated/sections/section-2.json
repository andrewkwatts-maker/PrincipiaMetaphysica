We introduce the -dimensional action with signature (24,2) decomposing as M 26 = M A 14 ⊗ T M B 14 , where each 14D half has signature (12,2) with 2 shared timelike dimensions . Sp(2,R) gauge symmetry eliminates ghost states from the two-time structure, projecting onto an effective 13D (12,1) shadow. We derive the 4D effective action through Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction on a TCS (Twisted Connected Sum) G₂ manifold with h1,1=4 Kähler moduli sectors . Racetrack moduli stabilization across these sectors dynamically derives ε ≈ 0.2257 (Cabibbo angle) from flux quantization N₁=24, N₂=23. The D→13D shadow framework provides a Z₂ mirror brane structure with geometrically-derived generation count n gen = 3. The Pneuma-Vielbein bridge (v15.1) validates metric emergence from spinor bilinears with Lorentzian signature (-,+,+,+)."
