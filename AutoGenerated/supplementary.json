Our two-time framework provides a mechanism to boost tunneling rates to testable levels (S E ~ 100), but this requires tuning ηΔt ortho to sit precisely at the anthropic boundary. Key virtue: Despite being speculative, these predictions are falsifiable before measurement . We predict P > 10 -3 bubble collision probability, testable with CMB-S4 (2027+). If null result: multiverse component constrained but framework survives (tunneling simply suppressed below detection threshold). If positive detection: rare empirical window into landscape physics. Honest classification: This work demonstrates the methodology for turning fringe ideas (eternal inflation, landscape multiverse) into rigorous science by deriving concrete observables. Even if ultimately falsified, the exercise shows how two-time physics interfaces with speculative cosmology."
