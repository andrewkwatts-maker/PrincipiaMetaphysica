## [16.2] - 2025-12-31 "True Lock"

### Added
- **42 Demon-Lock Certificates**: Complete certificate framework with all constants locked within 2σ
- **Thawing Quintessence Formula**: w₀ = -1 + 1/b₃ = -23/24 ≈ -0.9583
- **Three Topological Seeds**: b₃=24, k_gimel=12.3183098862, φ=(1+√5)/2
- **Publication-ready validation**: Global χ²/dof = 0.26
- **Zenodo packaging script**: `scripts/zenodo_pack_v16.py` with --validate flag
- **PROOFS directory**: Formal derivations with chain of custody

### Changed
- Dark energy formula from D_eff to thawing quintessence (matches DESI 2025 at 0.02σ)
- Certificate count reduced from 43 to 42 (merged redundant Final Closure with Unity Seal)
- Higgs Mass certificate promoted from C43 to C42 ("The Answer")

### Fixed
- Lambda formula precision: 1/(b₃·k)^49 = 10⁻¹²² (Planck units)
- Strong coupling formula: α_s = k/(b₃(π+1) + k/2) ≈ 0.117

## [16.1.1] - 2025-12-29 "Rigor"

### Added
- Rigorous symbolic verification pipeline
- 116 formulas with complete derivation chains
- Cross-validation across multiple experimental sources

### Changed
- Fine structure constant precision to CODATA 2022 (137.035999177)
- Neutrino mixing angles updated to NuFIT 6.0

## [16.1] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- Muon g-2 topological torsion mechanism
- Geometric seesaw for neutrino mass sum (Σmν = 0.099 eV)
- 38/38 simulations passing (100%)

## [16.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- G₂ manifold compactification framework
- SO(10) gauge unification emergence
- Hubble tension resolution via Ricci flow
- Dark energy equation of state predictions
- PMNS matrix derivation from octonionic structure

### Initial Release
- Complete unified physics framework
- Three fermion generations from χ_eff/48 = 144/48 = 3
- Two-Time Thermal Hypothesis for time emergence
