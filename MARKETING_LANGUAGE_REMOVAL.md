## Examples of Transformations

### Example 1: Grade Removal
**Before:**
```html
<div style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: 700; color: #4caf50;">A+</div>
<p>Final Score: 48/50 base points + 48/50 bonus points = 96/100 → A+ (97/100)</p>
```

**After:**
```html
[Completely removed]
```

### Example 2: Status Badge Transformation
**Before:**
```html
<span class="status-badge status-resolved">EXACT MATCH</span>
```

**After:**
```html
<span class="status-badge status-resolved">Agreement</span>
```

### Example 3: Marketing to Academic Prose
**Before:**
```
Perfect match! m_h = 125.10 GeV - exact match to 0.0σ!
```

**After:**
```
m_h = 125.10 GeV (experimental value: 125.10 ± 0.14 GeV, 0.0σ)
```

### Example 4: Self-Congratulatory Removal
**Before:**
```
Getting 10 of 14 real-world predictions within 1σ (including 3 exact matches) with 100% parameter
derivation and all 14 theoretical issues resolved earns a well-deserved A+ grade!
```

**After:**
```
10 of 14 predictions within 1σ (including 3 agreements with experiment) with complete parameter
derivation and all 14 theoretical issues resolved.
```

### Example 5: Technical Emphasis Cleaning
**Before:**
```
n_gen = χ_eff/48 = 144/48 = 3 EXACT
```

**After:**
```
n_gen = χ_eff/48 = 144/48 = 3
```

## Technical Details

### Patterns Matched

Regular expressions used to identify marketing language:
- Grade markers: `\b(A\+|A-|B\+|[0-9]{2}/100)\b`
- Exact claims: `(EXACT|exact match|perfect match)`
- Announcements: `(New!|Updated!|✓|\ud83c\udf89)`
- Marketing: `(publication-ready|breakthrough|exciting|amazing)`
- Self-praise: `(well-deserved|earns|achieves complete)`

### Methodology
1. Automated pattern scanning across all HTML files
2. Manual review of each match for context
3. Intelligent replacement preserving scientific meaning
4. Verification of HTML validity post-modification
5. Cross-reference checking for consistency

## Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total HTML files scanned | 58 |
| Files with marketing language | 11 |
| Total pattern matches | 150+ |

## Conclusion

The Principia Metaphysica website has been successfully transformed from a marketing-oriented presentation to a professional academic resource. All promotional language, grade markers, and self-congratulatory phrases have been systematically removed while preserving:

1. **Scientific Accuracy:** All numerical values, formulas, and experimental comparisons remain unchanged
2. **Technical Precision:** Mathematical notation and scientific terminology preserved
3. **Informational Content:** All factual statements maintained
4. **Professional Tone:** Language now appropriate for peer review and academic publication

The framework is now presented in measured, professional language suitable for:
- Peer-reviewed academic journals
- Conference presentations
- Graduate-level physics education
- Professional physics community review

**No scientific claims were weakened or removed** - only the promotional tone was neutralized. The website now presents the theory's achievements through factual statements and precise experimental comparisons rather than marketing hyperbole.
