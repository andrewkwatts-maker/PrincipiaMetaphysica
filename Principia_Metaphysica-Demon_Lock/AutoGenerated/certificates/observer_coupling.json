  "theoretical_significance": "In v16.2, the 'Observer' is not external to the theory but is mathematically coupled to the manifold structure. The coupling constant α_observer = 1.0 ensures that computational predictions are decidable (can be computed in finite time with finite precision). This addresses foundational questions about the relationship between mind, computation, and physical reality. The fact that computation can accurately represent G₂ geometry suggests that 'Mind' or 'Computation' is not an accident but the mechanism through which the manifold's potential is realized.",
