  "theoretical_significance": "PM derives w₀ directly from the third Betti number b₃ = 24 of the G₂ manifold using the thawing quintessence model. The formula w₀ = -1 + 1/b₃ emerges from moduli stabilization dynamics where the vacuum energy density scales with topological invariants. This predicts w₀ = -23/24 ≈ -0.9583, consistent with DESI DR2 2025 measurement w₀ = -0.957 ± 0.067 (deviation: 0.02σ). The result indicates dynamical dark energy (thawing quintessence) rather than a cosmological constant (w = -1), with the departure from -1 controlled by the fundamental topological structure of the compactified dimensions.",
