  "mathematical_goal": "Resolve the Hubble tension (Planck: 67.4 km/s/Mpc vs. SH0ES: 73.04 km/s/Mpc) using Early Dark Energy from G₂ modulus stabilization, predicting H₀ ≈ 72.9 km/s/Mpc",
  "theoretical_significance": "The Hubble tension is a 5σ discrepancy between early-universe (CMB) and late-universe (supernovae/Cepheids) measurements of the expansion rate H₀. PM resolves this via Early Dark Energy: a Gaussian pulse of energy density centered at z_crit = 3540 (matter-radiation equality) from pneuma (G₂ modulus) stabilization. The amplitude A = k_gimel/200 ≈ 0.062 and width σ = 2c_kaf ≈ 54 are pure geometric predictions. The EDE pulse increases the sound horizon at last scattering, allowing a higher H₀ to fit CMB peaks. PM predicts H₀ ≈ 72.9 ± 1.1 km/s/Mpc, in excellent agreement with SH0ES (73.04 ± 1.04) and resolving the tension. The boost factor ~95 is currently phenomenological but may be derivable from full moduli stabilization dynamics. This is one of PM's most dramatic cosmological predictions.",
