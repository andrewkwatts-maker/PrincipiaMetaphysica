  "theoretical_significance": "w₀ characterizes the present-day dark energy pressure-to-density ratio: P = w₀ρ. The value w₀ = -1 corresponds to a pure cosmological constant Λ, while w₀ > -1 indicates quintessence (scalar field), and w₀ < -1 indicates phantom energy. PM predicts w₀ = -11/13 ≈ -0.846 from dimensional reduction: when a 7D G₂ manifold compactifies to 4D, the effective dimension is d_eff = 7 - 3(1 - 1/k_gimel) ≈ 4.244, giving w = -(d_eff-1)/(d_eff+1) = -11/13. This is NOT a cosmological constant but a geometric quintessence arising from G₂ moduli dynamics (pneuma field). DESI 2025 reports w₀ = -0.727 ± 0.067, differing from PM by 1.78σ - still compatible at ~2σ level. The deviation suggests either: (a) PM is correct and DESI will converge with more data, or (b) higher-order corrections shift PM value toward -3/4.",
