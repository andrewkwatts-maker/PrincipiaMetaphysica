# References Page - Quick Start Guide

## Quick Fix Summary
The references page was failing to load due to incorrect path resolution. This has been fixed.

## What Was Fixed
1. Cleaned up path array in `Pages/references.html` (removed duplicates)
2. Enhanced JSON parsing to handle object format (current) and array format
3. Improved error messages
4. Created validation tools

## Testing (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Validate the JSON file
```bash
python validate_references.py
```
Expected output: `✅ Validation passed!`

### Step 2: Start the web server
**Windows:**
```cmd
start_server.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x start_server.sh
./start_server.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Step 3: Open in browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:8000/Pages/references.html

You should see:
- 34 references loaded
- Grouped by decade (2020s, 2010s, etc.)
- Search box working
- Filter buttons working
- Citation counts displayed

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: File exists
```bash
dir AutoGenerated\references.json    # Windows
ls AutoGenerated/references.json      # Linux/Mac
```

### Check 2: JSON is valid
```bash
python validate_references.py
```

### Check 3: Browser console
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check which path succeeded
4. Should see: `[References] Successfully loaded from: ../AutoGenerated/references.json`

### Check 4: CORS issue
Make sure you're using http://localhost:8000, NOT file:///

## Files Modified

## Expected Console Output (Success)
```
[References] Starting to load references...
[References] Attempting to fetch from: ../AutoGenerated/references.json
[References] Response status for ../AutoGenerated/references.json: 200 OK
[References] Successfully parsed JSON from ../AutoGenerated/references.json
[References] Converted to array, length: 34
[References] Successfully rendered references
```

## Next Steps
Once the basic page works:
1. Test search functionality
2. Test filter buttons (All, By Year, By Author, Most Cited)
3. Click on arXiv/DOI links to verify they work
4. Check citation badges show correct counts
