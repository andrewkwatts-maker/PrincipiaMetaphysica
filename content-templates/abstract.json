Beginning in a {D_bulk}-dimensional bulk spacetime of signature (24,2), Sp(2,R) gauge fixing yields an effective {D_after_sp2r}-dimensional intermediate stage, followed by compactification on the G₂ manifold to produce the observed {D_observable}D universe with three chiral fermion generations determined topologically from the flux-dressed Euler characteristic (n_gen = |χ_eff|/48 = {n_gen}).",

Two numerical coefficients are transparently calibrated to the electroweak and GUT scales; the observed Higgs mass constrains one complex structure modulus. The remaining 55 parameters emerge as pure predictions.",

Additional geometric predictions — proton decay branching ratios and gravitational wave dispersion — await confirmation by future experiments.",
