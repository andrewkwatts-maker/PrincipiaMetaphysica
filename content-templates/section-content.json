    "description": "The theory begins with a 26D bulk spacetime with signature (24,2), incorporating two timelike dimensions. Sp(2,R) gauge symmetry eliminates ghosts and negative-norm states, projecting to a 13D effective shadow."

    "description": "SO(10) grand unification emerges naturally from the G₂ holonomy structure. The GUT scale M_GUT = 2.12×10¹⁶ GeV is derived from torsion on the G₂ manifold."
