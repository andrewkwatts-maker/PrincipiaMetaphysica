## Summary
Field equations are derived by varying the 27D master action with respect to
each dynamical field (metric, flux, fermions, moduli, torsion). After G₂
compactification, these yield the effective 4D equations governing gravity,
gauge forces, and matter.

## Key Equations

### 1. 27D Einstein Equations (with torsion)
G_MN + Λ₂₇ g_MN = κ₂₇² (T_MN^flux + T_MN^moduli + T_MN^torsion)

### 2. G-Flux Equation of Motion
d*F₄ + (1/2)F₄ ∧ F₄ = J₃ (source current from branes)

### 3. 4D Effective Einstein Equations
G_μν + Λ_eff g_μν = 8πG_N T_μν^eff
where:
- Λ_eff = Λ₂₇/V_internal ≈ 10^{-52} m^{-2}
- G_N = G₂₇/V_internal
- T_μν^eff includes moduli kinetic + potential + flux energy density

### 4. Moduli Equations
□T_i + ∂V/∂T_i = 0 (racetrack stabilization)
V = Σ Λ_i exp(-a_i T_i) + Λ₀

### 5. Torsion Equation
T^a_{bc} = (1/6)ε_{bcdefg} φ^{defg} (from G₂ associative 3-form)

### 6. Dirac Equation on G₂
(iγ^μ D_μ + Σ_n R_n m_n γ⁵) ψ = 0
where R_n = exp(-λ_n/b₃) are spectral residue mass corrections

### 7. Ricci Flow (moduli evolution)
∂g_ij/∂τ = -2R_ij + (2/n)R g_ij (Hamilton-Perelman)
Applied to G₂ metric under racetrack potential constraints

## Updates Needed
1. gr_spacetime.py: Add full 27D→4D Einstein equation chain
2. gauge_sector_complete.py: Add flux EOM and SO(10) breaking
3. matter_sector_complete.py: Add Dirac on G₂ with spectral residues
4. f_r_t_tau_gravity.py: Ensure f(R,T,τ) matches 4D effective gravity

## Implementation Priority: HIGH
