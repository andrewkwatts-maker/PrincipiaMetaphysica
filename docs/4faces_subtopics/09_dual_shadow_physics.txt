## Summary
Detailed physics of light, particles, and interactions across the two
CPT-mirrored shadows connected by Euclidean bridges and OR reduction.

## Light Propagation

### Primary (Our) Shadow
- Forward-directed null geodesics (ds²=0) at speed c
- Left-chiral weak coupling (SM standard)
- Transverse, polarized, causal (no superluminal)
- Quantum: massless spin-1, unitary evolution until collapse

### Mirror (Second) Shadow  
- Same speed c along local null geodesics
- RIGHT-chiral weak coupling (parity-reversed)
- Maxwell equations identical in form (photons not chiral)
- Same time coordinate t (shared), forward flow
- CPT conjugate of first shadow

### Cross-Shadow (Quantum)
- Euclidean bridge allows "reflection" → apparent time reversal in projection
- OR reduction R_⊥² = -I: Möbius twist → sign flip → time-reversal phase
- S⁷ symmetry from dim(O)=8: hyperspherical photon wavefunction
- Amplitudes for forward AND backward time (suppressed macroscopically)
- No classical superluminal signaling

## Particle Properties in Second Shadow
1. CHIRALITY REVERSAL: fermions right-handed for weak force
2. Same particle spectrum: 3 generations, same gauge group
3. Same masses, mixing angles (mirror images, phase conjugate under CPT)
4. Shared time t, same thermodynamic arrow
5. Same dark energy w₀=-23/24, same H₀

## Cross-Shadow Communication Mechanisms

### 1. OR Reduction Sampling (Primary)
- Coherent cross-shadow sampling via R_⊥
- Non-local quantum correlations (geometric EPR)
- Testable via Bell inequality violations in entangled systems

### 2. Bridge-Mediated Tunneling (Instantons)
- Instanton paths through Euclidean bridge
- Suppressed by exp(-χ_eff/b₃) ≈ exp(-6) ≈ 0.0025
- Manifest as ultra-weak shadow mixing in rare events

### 3. Spectral Residue Overlap
- Higher modes (n > 94) leak between shadows
- Strength ~ exp(-λ_n/b₃) for large n
- Potential: flavor-changing neutral currents, dark matter portals

### 4. Consciousness Effects (Speculative)
- Orch-OR in microtubules may sample both shadows
- τ ≈ 0.025s collapse time
- Testable via EEG/quantum biology anomalies

## Shared Time (Single Dimension)
- 27D bulk: one unified time (0,1)
- G₂ compactification: purely spatial (7,0)
- Both shadows: same forward time t
- NO separate time dimensions per shadow
- Quantum bidirectionality only (amplitudes, not classical)

## Updates Needed
1. geometric_anchors.py: Formalize shadow architecture parameters
2. bridge_pressure.py: Add cross-shadow coupling formulas
3. dark_energy.py: Add shadow contribution to vacuum energy
4. pneuma_mechanism.py: Incorporate OR cross-shadow sampling

## Implementation Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH
