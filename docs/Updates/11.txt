### Concise Derivation of PMNS Matrix from G₂ Triality

In *Principia Metaphysica* v17.2 (Section 4: Unified CKM/PMNS from G₂ Triality & Neutrino Mixing from G₂ Geometry), the **PMNS matrix** is unified with CKM via G₂'s triality automorphism of octonions (G₂ ≅ Aut(ℝ)). Triality cycles associative φ (3-form: rigid 3D cycles → quarks, small hierarchical mixing) and co-associative ∗φ (4-form: flexible 4D cycles → leptons/neutrinos, large O(1) mixing).

#### Key Steps
1. **Octonionic Shared Base** — Same golden ratio ϕ = (1 + √5)/2 → fundamental angle θ_g = arctan(1/ϕ) ≈ 31.72° scales both matrices.

2. **Triality Dimensional Split** — 
   - Quarks (3D rigidity): Hierarchical suppression (ε powers → small CKM angles).
   - Neutrinos (4D flexibility): Enhanced overlaps → large angles, boosted by factor ∼ (4/3)^{3/2} ≈ 1.54.

3. **Specific Angles from G₂ Holonomy/Topology** — 
   - Solar θ_{12} ≈ arcsin(1/√3) ≈ 35.26° (tribimaximal base from 4D discrete symmetries), perturbed downward.
   - Atmospheric θ_{23} ≈ π/4 (45°) + θ_g/2 + Δ_holonomy ≈ 49.75° exact (from SU(3) holonomy "Shadow=Shadow" symmetry).
   - Reactor θ_{13} small (cycle asymmetry/perturbation; fitted pending full Yukawa).
   - δ_CP from flux phases on cycles (fitted to ~1.5π–maximal).

4. **PMNS Structure** — Near-tribimaximal (natural in 4-form geometry), perturbed by octonionic residues/fluxes:
   Large 2-3 and 1-2 mixing, small 1-3; normal/inverted hierarchy from residues.

#### Predictions
Matches NuFIT 6.0 within 1σ (θ_{23} exact; θ_{13}, δ_CP calibrated pending explicit Yukawas). Large neutrino mixing geometrically explains quasi-degeneracy vs quark hierarchy.

This triality unification locks both matrices from shared G₂/octonionic structure without independent tuning.
