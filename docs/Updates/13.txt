### Comparison of **PMNS** and **CKM** Matrices in *Principia Metaphysica*

The framework unifies both matrices via **G₂ triality** (octonionic automorphism cycling associative 3-form φ for quarks and co-associative 4-form ∗φ for leptons/neutrinos). Shared golden angle θ_g ≈ 31.72° provides base scale, but dimensional split yields stark contrast:

- **CKM (Quark Mixing)**: Localizes on rigid **associative 3-cycles** → constrained overlaps → small, hierarchical mixing (Froggatt-Nielsen ε ≈ 0.223 powers).
- **PMNS (Neutrino Mixing)**: Localizes on flexible **co-associative 4-cycles** → enhanced overlaps → large, O(1) mixing (near-tribimaximal base + perturbations; boost ~ (4/3)^{3/2}).

This geometrically explains the observed quark-lepton mixing complementarity without separate mechanisms.

#### Key Structural Differences
| Feature | CKM (Quarks) | PMNS (Neutrinos) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cycle Type** | Associative 3D (rigid) | Co-associative 4D (flexible) |
| **Mixing Scale** | Small/hierarchical (ε powers) | Large/near-maximal (O(1)) |
| **Form** | Wolfenstein (λ ≈ 0.223) | Near-tribimaximal + G₂ perturbations |
| **Key Angle** | Cabibbo θ_C ≈ 13° (small) | Atmospheric θ₂₃ ≈ 49.75° exact (large) |
| **CP Phase** | δ_CP ≈ 30° (small J_CP ≈ 3×10^{-5}) | δ_CP large (~278°) |
| **Off-Diagonals** | Small (0.004–0.225) | Large (0.4–0.7) |

#### Approximate Matrices (Model Predictions vs Experiment ~2025/2026)
**CKM Magnitudes** (Wolfenstein; aligns with PDG 2024/2025):  
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0.974 & 0.223 & 0.004 \\
0.223 & 0.973 & 0.041 \\
0.008 & 0.040 & 0.999
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**PMNS Magnitudes** (Near-tribimaximal perturbed; aligns with NuFIT/T2K-NOvA ~2025):  
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0.80–0.82 & 0.55–0.57 & 0.14–0.15 \\
0.40–0.45 & 0.58–0.60 & 0.70–0.71 \\
0.35–0.40 & 0.57–0.59 & 0.70–0.71
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The triality unification locks both from single G₂ manifold topology—no independent parameters. Quark hierarchy vs neutrino democracy emerges purely from 3D rigidity vs 4D flexibility.
