### Derivation of the Sterile Angle θ in *Principia Metaphysica*

The **sterile angle** θ is the intersection angle between the two 13D shadow branes during dimensional descent (post-SpR(2) gauge fixing, in the transition to observable 4D residues). It represents the geometric "bottleneck" fraction of ancestral symmetry that manifests as the 125 observable constants.

#### Explicit Formula (from Appendix K: Sterile Constant Table & Section Outputs)
$$
\theta = \arcsin\left( \frac{125}{288} \right) \approx 25.72^\circ
$$

#### Step-by-Step Geometric Origin
1. **125**: Number of extracted 4D residues (fundamental constants/particles; the "observable pinches" in the 125-residue spectral registry).

2. **288**: Total ancestral roots in the higher-D symmetry architecture  
   $$
   R_{\text{ancestral}} = 276 + 24 - 12 = 288
   $$  
   (From Appendix H: 288-Root Basis; derived from SO(24) contributions adjusted by signature/torsion factors in the 26D(24,2) bulk).

3. **Ratio Interpretation**: $\sin \theta = \frac{125}{288} \approx 0.434$ → the projection fraction of ancestral roots surviving as sterile observables (bottleneck ~43.4% in sine measure).

4. **Role**: Locks the fine structure constant α as a function of θ (e.g., via shadow brane overlap integrals in U(1)_EM precursor cycle).

This angle ensures sterility: only geometrically permitted residues emerge, unifying α ≈ 1/137.036 with manifold topology without tuning.
