### Parameter Residue Derivation in *Principia Metaphysica*

In the framework (v17.2), the **125 fundamental physical constants** (particle masses, couplings, mixing angles, cosmological parameters) are not independent or tuned—they are **spectral residues** extracted as discrete eigenvalues from the geometry of a single twisted connected sum **G₂ manifold** (V₇, TCS #187). This is the core of the "sterile extraction" methodology (Section 2), ensuring no fine-tuning: parameters are locked topological invariants.

#### Core Mechanism: Spectral Geometry
The universe is treated as a resonant 7D cavity (V₇ with Ricci-flat, torsion-free G₂ holonomy). Physical constants are the natural harmonic frequencies (Laplacian eigenvalues) of this shape:

$$
\Delta_{V_7} \Psi = \lambda_n \Psi
\qquad \text{(laplacian-eigenvalue)}
$$

- **Δ_{V_7}**: Laplace-Beltrami operator on V₇ (encoded with manifold metric/volume).
- **λ_n**: nth eigenvalue → corresponds to one of the 125 residues (e.g., low λ_n for cosmological constants like Λ or H₀; high λ_n for particle masses like m_top).
- **Ψ**: Eigenfunction (waveform at brane-node intersection).

Path independence from G₂ holonomy ensures the same value whether derived via gauge, fermion, or scalar sector.

#### The 125-Residue Registry
Residues manifest at **brane-node intersections** in the higher-D lattice (post-13D → 7D descent). The lattice is topologically locked (G₂ packing fraction fixes distances/ratios).

Partitioned into **4 Symmetry Banks** (reflecting SpR(2) breaking path):
1. **Bank I (Metric Nodes 1–18)**: Vacuum constants (Λ, G, c, ℏ, w₀ dark energy).
2. **Bank II (Gauge Nodes 19–45)**: Force intersections → couplings (g_s, g_2, g', α).
3. **Bank III (Matter Nodes 46–112)**: Fermion generations/masses/mixing (quarks/leptons, CKM/PMNS).
4. **Bank IV (Scalar & Coupling Nodes 113–125)**: Higgs sector + final unifications.

Magnitude from local brane tension:
- High tension → large residues (e.g., m_top).
- Tangential → small/sterile (e.g., neutrino masses ~10^{-50} floor).

#### Closure & Sterility: Global Metric Lock
Completeness verified by Selberg-type trace formula:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{125} f(\lambda_n) \approx \text{Vol}(V_7)
\qquad \text{(trace-formula)}
$$

- Inherited from 26D(24,2) "Symmetry Budget."
- Deviation flags "Non-Sterile" → enforces exact 125 residues only.

#### Examples from Document
- Fermion generations: n_gen = b₃ / 8 = 24 / 8 = 3 (Betti number).
- Fine structure α^{-1}: From specific eigenvalue ratio + golden angle ϕ.
- Masses/ratios: Shadow lengths through CY₃ filter.
- Cosmological: Low-frequency modes trapped in b₃ cycles.

All derivations are "cryptographically locked" via 72 Wolfram certificates (Appendix F/G). Full explicit table in **Appendix A** (125-Residue Spectral Registry)—parameters are pure predictions (55 exact, others within 1σ via minor fluxes/residues).

This shifts physics from empirical fitting to geometric inevitability: the 125 values are the only permitted vibrations of V₇.
