### Derivation of the Weak Mixing Angle (sin² θ_W) in *Principia Metaphysica*

The weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle, determining the ratio of W and Z boson couplings/masses) derives in **Section 6** (page ~95) via **inverse cubic contraction** through the **Torsion Gate** during dimensional projection (similar to Compton wavelength, Avogadro number, etc.).

#### Explicit Formula
$$
\sin^2 \theta_W = \frac{\sin^2 \theta_{W,\text{bulk}}}{1 + \epsilon}
$$

- **θ_{W,bulk}** — High-scale (bulk/13D or GUT precursor) value, typically ~0.25 (unified regime from shared residues).
- **ε** — Small geometric suppression (~0.223–0.231, from Froggatt-Nielsen curvature or torsion residue; same ε as Cabibbo scale in CKM).
- **Torsion Gate** — Mechanism for "thinning" couplings as the 3D grid expands in descent (inverse cubic projection from higher-D torsion funnel, Appendix J).

#### Step-by-Step Rationale
1. **Bulk Origin** — At high scale (13D shadow or G₂ compactification), couplings unify closer to sin² θ_W ≈ 0.25 (residue ratio from shared gauge nodes).
2. **Inverse Cubic Contraction** — During 7D → 4D projection, torsion on associative cycles "contracts" the effective mixing ratio inversely with volume expansion (cubic due to 3D grid scaling).
3. **Torsion Gate Effect** — As the observable 3D space expands, the mixing "thins" slightly: denominator (1 + ε) reduces the bulk value to low-energy observed ~0.231.
4. **Numerical Match** — With ε ≈ 0.08–0.10 (torsion-tuned), yields sin² θ_W ≈ 0.231 (matches PDG/NuFIT within 1σ).

This geometric contraction locks the value without running/RG tuning—pure residue from torsion projection. Similar "inverse cubic" used for other precision constants (e.g., Compton, Faraday).
