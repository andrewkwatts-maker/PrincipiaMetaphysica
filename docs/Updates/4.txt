### Derivation of Non-Abelian Gauge Terms from the Master Action in *Principia Metaphysica*

In *Principia Metaphysica* v17.2, non-Abelian gauge fields for **SU(3)_C** (QCD) and **SU(2)_L** (weak force), along with **U(1)_Y** (hypercharge), emerge during dimensional descent, specifically in the G₂ manifold stage and 6D Calabi-Yau projection (Section 1.4). The master action starts with the higher-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert term (plus Pneuma spinor couplings) in 26D/13D. Non-Abelian structure arises from geometric features:

- **Singularities in the G₂ manifold** (twisted connected sum TCS #187): Conical or orbifold singularities with ADE classification support enhanced non-Abelian symmetries. Coincident singularities or resolved cycles yield SU(N), SO(N), or exceptional groups; the model tunes these to exactly SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) via spectral residues and flux quantization on associative 3-cycles.
- **Brane-node intersections** (Section 2.2, Gauge Nodes 19–45): "Force branes" intersect at points hosting SU(3)/SU(2) symmetries, with the non-commuting structure constants inherited from G₂ holonomy decomposition into SU(3) subgroups.
- **Projection to Calabi-Yau submanifold**: The explicit emergence of SU(3)_C × SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y is stated in eq. (cy3-projection): V₇ → CY₃ yielding the SM gauge group.

The derivation of kinetic terms follows Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of the higher-D Ricci scalar R over the internal geometry, generalized to non-Abelian cases.

#### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Higher-Dimensional Master Action (Simplified Gravity Part)**:  
   The relevant part for gauge kinetics is the Einstein-Hilbert term (M_* fundamental scale):  
   $$
   S \supset M_*^{D-2} \int d^D X \sqrt{-G} \, R^{(D)}
   $$  
   (D=13 post-SpR(2), or effectively 11D in M-theory limit).

2. **Generalized KK Ansatz for Non-Abelian Isometries/Singularities**:  
   For a compact internal manifold with (effective) isometry group G (or singularity enhancing to G), expand the metric using Killing vectors ξ_a^i (or Maurer-Cartan forms for group manifolds):  
   $$
   ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}(x) dx^\mu dx^\nu + \phi_{ab}(y,x) (dy^a + A_\mu^b(x) \xi_b^i dy^i)(dy^a + A_\nu^c(x) \xi_c^j dy^j) + \cdots
   $$  
   More standardly, for left-invariant forms σ^a on group/coset:  
   $$
   ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu + r^2 \, \eta_{ab} (\sigma^a + k A^{b}_\mu dx^\mu)(\sigma^b + k A^{c}_\nu dx^\nu)
   $$  
   where η_{ab} is the invariant metric on G, r the "radius" (volume modulus, fixed by G₂ spectral residues), and k normalization.

3. **Field Strength and Non-Abelian Structure**:  
   The gauge field A_\mu = A_\mu^a T^a (T^a generators in adjoint), with non-Abelian field strength:  
   $$
   F_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a + k f^a_{bc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c
   $$  
   where f^a_{bc} are structure constants from the internal geometry (e.g., from dσ^a = (1/2) f^a_{bc} σ^b ∧ σ^c in G₂ singularity bases).

4. **Reduced Action and Gauge Kinetic Terms**:  
   Substituting into R^{(D)} yields (after integration over internal volume Vol(K)):  
   - 4D EH term: M_{Pl}^2 \int \sqrt{-g} R^{(4)}, with M_{Pl}^2 \propto M_*^{D-4} Vol(K).
   - Non-Abelian Yang-Mills terms:  
     $$
     \mathcal{L}_{YM} \supset -\frac{1}{4} f_G \, \text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu})
     $$  
     where f_G \propto Vol(cycle_G)^{p} (p depending on cycle dimension; for associative 3-cycles in G₂, often \propto Vol^{4/3} or similar), and Tr over adjoint. In the sterile model, f_G is locked to spectral eigenvalues, unifying couplings (e.g., GUT scale from shared residues).

   For multiple groups (SU(3), SU(2)), separate terms with independent f_{SU(3)}, f_{SU(2)} from different cycles/singularities.

This recovers canonical QCD/SU(3) and weak/SU(2) Lagrangians at low energies, with running couplings from renormalization (higher-D effects suppressed).

#### Python Script for Explicit Symbolic Computation (Toy Model: SU(2) Non-Abelian)

Below is a self-contained script `non_abelian_kk_gauge.py` using SymPy to illustrate the emergence of non-Abelian terms. It uses a simplified toy reduction on SU(2) ~ S^3 (round metric), a common example where pure gravity reduces to GR + SU(2) YM. This mirrors the G₂ singularity mechanism (SU(2) subgroup from G₂ ⊃ SU(3)).

In the full theory, replace SU(2) structure constants with those from G₂ associative cycles for SU(3)/SU(2).

#### Validation and Link to Document
- The non-Abelian self-interaction term (+ f^a_{bc} A^b A^c) is crucial (absent in Abelian case).
- In the model, structure constants f^a_{bc} from G₂ holonomy SU(3) subgroups (forcing shadow angles, etc.).
- Coefficient r fixed by "sterile extraction" (Laplacian eigenvalues), yielding unified couplings without tuning.

This extends the prior Abelian/gravity derivation to non-Abelian SM groups. For full SU(3)×SU(2), repeat with respective adjoint dimensions (8+3) and cycle-specific volumes.
