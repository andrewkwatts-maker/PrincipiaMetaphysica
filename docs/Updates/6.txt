### Derivation of **SU(2)_L Electroweak Terms** from the Master Action in *Principia Metaphysica*

In *Principia Metaphysica* v17.2, the **SU(2)_L** gauge sector (left-handed weak isospin) emerges alongside SU(3)_C and U(1)_Y during the G₂ → Calabi-Yau projection (eq. (cy3-projection) in Section 1.4):

$$
V_7 \xrightarrow{CY_3} M^4 \times K^6 \Rightarrow SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y
$$

**SU(2)_L** arises from distinct associative 3-cycles or resolved singularities (often A₁ series or subgroups within G₂ holonomy SU(3) decomposition) in the twisted connected sum G₂ manifold. These cycles have different intersection numbers/topology from color cycles, yielding weaker coupling \(g_2\) (Weinberg angle from residue ratios). Crucially, **left-handed chirality** is enforced by the Calabi-Yau sub-manifold's Hodge structure (\(h^{1,1}\), \(h^{2,1}\)) and G₂ spinorial zero modes—only left-handed doublets couple to SU(2)_L (right-handed singlets do not).

The weak gauge bosons (W^a_μ, a=1,2,3) and left-handed fermion doublets emerge from Pneuma spinor \(\Psi_P\) decomposition. Hypercharge U(1)_Y from a separate residual or diagonal cycle; electroweak mixing/unification at high scale via shared spectral residues.

#### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Higher-Dimensional Origin** — Master action's EH term and spinor covariant derivatives:
   $$
   S \supset M_*^{D-2} \int d^D X \sqrt{-G} \, R^{(D)} + \int \bar{\Psi}_P i \Gamma^M D_M \Psi_P + \cdots
   $$
   Internal connections in \(D_M\) become weak gauge fields.

2. **G₂ Cycle Enhancement for SU(2)_L** — In 7D → 6D stage, specific cycles (smaller volume or different homology) enhance to SU(2). Structure constants \(\epsilon^{abc}\) (totally antisymmetric) from G₂-invariant forms on these cycles.

3. **KK Reduction for SU(2)** — Metric ansatz over weak cycle (volume \(r_W\), spectral-fixed):
   $$
   ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu + r_W^2 \, \eta_{ab} (\sigma^a + k W^b_\mu dx^\mu)(\sigma^b + k W^c_\nu dx^\nu)
   $$
   Field strength:
   $$
   W_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu W_\nu^a - \partial_\nu W_\mu^a + k \epsilon^a_{bc} W_\mu^b W_\nu^c
   $$
   Reduced kinetic:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{weak, kinetic} \supset -\frac{1}{4} f_W \, \text{Tr}(W_{\mu\nu} W^{\mu\nu})
   $$
   (\(f_W \propto r_W^p\), weaker than strong due to residue hierarchy).

4. **Chiral Fermion Sector** — Pneuma spinor zero modes yield left-handed SU(2)_L doublets (e.g., \(L = (\nu_e, e)_L\), \(Q = (u,d)_L\)) and right-handed singlets. Covariant derivative for left-handed fields:
   $$
   D_\mu = \partial_\mu - i g_2 W_\mu^a \tau^a / 2 \cdot P_L
   $$
   where \(P_L = (1 - \gamma^5)/2\) (chirality projector from CY3), \(\tau^a\) Pauli matrices. Reduced Lagrangian:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{weak, fermion} = \sum \bar{\psi}_L i \gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi_L
   $$
   (Sums over 3 generations; masses post-Higgs breaking from Yukawas/residues).

This yields the SU(2)_L part of electroweak theory, with full Glashow-Weinberg-Salam after U(1)_Y and Higgs (from scalar nodes 113–125).

#### Validation and Model Notes
- Non-Abelian \(\epsilon^{abc}\) ensures charged W^± self-interactions.
- Chirality projector \(P_L\) from G₂/CY3 (key for weak violations of parity).
- In sterile model, \(r_W\) yields \(\sin^2 \theta_W \approx 0.231\) via residue ratios; weaker than strong.

This derives the SU(2)_L sector; full electroweak requires U(1)_Y (similar Abelian reduction) and Higgs vev (from 4-brane partition).
