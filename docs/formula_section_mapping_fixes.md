### Formulas Referenced in Equations but Not in formula_refs

Some formulas appear in section content blocks as equations but are not listed in `formula_refs`:

- `26d-signature` appears in Section 1.1 content
- `g2-holonomy` appears in Section 1.3 content
- `b3-generations` appears in Section 1.3 content
- `w0-derivation` appears in Section 3.2 content
- `vacuum-floor` appears in Section 3.3 content

These should be added to the respective section's `formula_refs` array.

## Invalid References

The audit found 1 invalid reference:
- Section A references `node-distribution-function` which does not exist in `formulas.json`
- **Action:** Either create this formula or remove the reference from Section A

---

## Implementation Priority

### Priority 1: Fix Content Mismatches (Immediate)
Formulas appearing in section content but missing from `formula_refs`:
- Add `26d-signature`, `g2-holonomy`, `b3-generations` to Section 1
- Add `w0-derivation`, `vacuum-floor` to Section 3

### Priority 2: Core Physics Mappings
- Section 3 cosmology formulas (24 formulas)
- Section 4 mixing matrix formulas (15 formulas)
- Section 6 electroweak formulas (13 formulas)

### Priority 3: v18 Derivation Appendices
- Create Appendix M-Q structure in sections.json
- Map 39+ v18 formulas to appropriate appendices

### Priority 4: Validation/Miscellaneous
- Appendix G additions
- Other specialized formulas

---

## Notes

1. The `gr-*-v19` formulas (15 total) are referenced in section "2.2" via `formula_refs` array, but they may have been marked as orphans due to an audit issue with subsection mapping.

2. Several formulas have duplicate functionality (e.g., `w0-derivation` and `w0-betti-derivation`). Consider consolidation.

3. Appendix M-Q do not currently exist in sections.json. They would need to be created first before formula mappings can be added.

4. The `thermal-time` section already has 4 formulas properly mapped.
