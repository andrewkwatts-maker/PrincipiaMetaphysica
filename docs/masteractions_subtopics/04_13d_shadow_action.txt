SUB-TOPIC 04: 13D Shadow Lagrangian (Dimensional Reduction from 27D)
Source: MasterActionsPortalsAxionsAndSterileNeutrenos.txt (Part 3)
===================================================================

After bridge/global OR acts, the 27D bulk separates into two 13D shadow manifolds (13 = 4 spacetime + 9 internal dimensions per shadow). This is the intermediate-energy action before face/local OR selects the dominant visible face.

1. Reduction Mechanism
-----------------------
The bridge/global OR tensor product R_perp^global = tensor_{i=1}^{12} R_{perp,i} collapses the wavefunction over the 14 bridge directions (12 pairs + central C^(2,0) bridge + 1 shared temporal direction).

This produces two mirror-image 13D shadow manifolds:
- Shadow 1 (our shadow): Left-handed chirality (SU(2)_L doublets)
- Shadow 2 (mirror shadow): Right-handed chirality (SU(2)_R doublets)

The bridge becomes Euclidean (no time) after OR -- classical crossing is forbidden.

2. 13D Per-Shadow Lagrangian (After Bridge/Global OR)
------------------------------------------------------
S_{13D} = integral sqrt(-g_{13}) [
  R_{13}
  + Psi_bar_P i gamma^m (partial_m + T_omega^m) Psi_P
  + V_face^{(f)(local OR)}
]

Where:
- R_{13}: 13D Ricci scalar (emergent from shadow-local bilinears)
- gamma^m: 13D gamma matrices (m = 0,1,...,12)
- T_omega^m = sqrt(b_3/chi_eff) = 1/sqrt(6): torsion (bridge pressure remnant)
- V_face^(f): Face/local OR warping potential (4 Kahler sectors per shadow)

3. Key Features of the 13D Action
------------------------------------
a) Chirality projection
   Bridge OR flips chirality: R_perp^2 = -I (Mobius boundary condition)
   Shadow 1: left-handed doublets + right-handed singlets
   Shadow 2: right-handed doublets + left-handed singlets

b) Three generations
   chi_eff / 48 = 144/48 = 3 fermion generations per shadow
   Each generation occupies one G2 triality orbit

c) Gauge group emergence
   Internal 9D manifold with G2 holonomy -> SO(10) -> G_SM
   SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y from Wilson lines on associative 3-cycles

d) Moduli sectors (4 faces)
   h^{1,1} = 4 Kahler moduli -> 4 geometric "faces" per shadow
   Each face has its own moduli vev T_i^(f) stabilized by racetrack potential

4. Face/Local OR Layer (Within 13D)
-------------------------------------
Face/local OR selects one dominant face (Face 1 = visible) and suppresses the other three:
  V_face^(f) = sum_{i=1}^4 Lambda_i e^{-(24/i) T_i^(f)} + (1/12) e^{-T_i^(f)/T_max}

After face OR:
- Face 1: full coupling (visible sector, all Standard Model particles)
- Faces 2-4: exponentially suppressed but with residual leakage alpha_leak ~ 0.57
  (dark matter sector, sterile neutrinos, ALPs, etc.)

5. Mirror Shadow Action (Shadow 2)
-------------------------------------
The mirror shadow 4D action is identical in structure but with:
- Chirality flipped (L <-> R everywhere)
- Independent moduli stabilization (T_i^(f) may differ)
- Same gauge group, same 3 generations
- Connected to Shadow 1 only through Euclidean bridge (quantum tunneling)

Conclusion
----------
The 13D shadow action is the intermediate step between the unified 27D bulk and the observable 4D effective theory. It captures the separation of physics into two mirror shadows, each with 4 faces and 3 generations, connected only by quantum tunneling through the timeless Euclidean bridge.
