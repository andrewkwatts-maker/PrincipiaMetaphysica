================================================================

High-level explanation of dark matter portals in the Principia Metaphysica v23.1 framework.

What a Dark Matter Portal Is
------------------------------
A dark matter portal is a geometric coupling between the visible sector (Face 1) and the three hidden faces (Faces 2-4) of the G2 structure. The coupling strength alpha_leak ~ 0.57 is derived from volume ratios, torsion, and flux asymmetry (see sub-topic 06).

What Dark Matter Portals Do (Main Effects)
--------------------------------------------

1. Produce the dark matter we observe
   In the hidden rooms, particles are created in large numbers (thermal freeze-out or misalignment).
   They leak through the portals into our visible sector -- becoming the invisible mass.
   Total leaked amount matches exactly Omega_DM h^2 ~ 0.12 (sum over three hidden faces).

2. Generate very weak fifth forces
   Portals are mediated by moduli fields.
   Creates tiny, long-range forces between ordinary matter and dark matter -- ~57% weaker than gravity.
   Range set by modulus mass (TeV-PeV scale -> very short range in practice).
   Could show up in torsion balances, atom interferometers.

3. Cause subtle particle physics anomalies
   - Flavor-changing neutral currents: tiny mixing between quarks/leptons in visible and hidden sectors
     -> small deviations in B-meson decays (LHCb, Belle II sensitivity)
   - Sterile neutrino mixing: hidden faces host right-handed neutrinos that leak into our world
     -> explain neutrino masses and oscillations (MiniBooNE, MicroBooNE anomalies)
   - Axion-like particles (ALPs): ultra-light scalars from moduli misalignment in hidden faces
     -> leak as very weak fifth forces or dark photons (ADMX, IAXO searches)

4. Contribute to extra radiation (Delta_N_eff)
   Hidden faces can have slightly different early-universe temperatures
   -> extra relativistic degrees of freedom leak into our sector
   -> Delta_N_eff ~ 0.1-0.3 (testable by CMB-S4, DESI)

5. Create faint gravitational wave echoes
   Torsion from portals modifies GW propagation
   -> small dispersion (eta ~ 0.10) or polarization anomalies (LIGO/Virgo O4/O5)

Strength & Limitations
-----------------------
- Coupling strength: ~0.57 (not weak enough to be invisible, not strong enough to be obvious)
- Mass scale: TeV-PeV for KK modes/moduli, meV-eV for ALPs, keV-MeV for sterile neutrinos
- Interaction type: scalar-mediated (moduli) or vector (dark photons), mostly spin-independent
- Detection window: exactly in range of current/future experiments:
  * Direct detection: XENONnT, LZ, PandaX (~10^{-47} cm^2)
  * Collider: LHC monojet + missing energy (TeV-scale portals)
  * Cosmology: CMB-S4, DESI (Delta_N_eff, w_0)
  * GW: LIGO/Virgo (dispersion eta ~ 0.10)

Key Implications
-----------------
- Dark matter is not a single exotic particle -- it's three parallel dark sectors leaking through geometric portals.
- The ~0.57 strength comes directly from G2 volume ratio (1/sqrt(6)), torsion (sqrt(1/6)), and flux asymmetry (1/b_3).
- The portals are universal -- every particle feels them (scalar-mediated), so dark matter interacts (weakly) with everything.
- If portals are confirmed, it would prove the four-face structure -- our visible physics is just one of four possible geometries.

Conclusion
----------
Dark matter portals are geometric couplings between our visible face and three hidden faces full of dark matter.
They leak just enough dark matter to explain galaxy rotation -- and just enough faint effects to be potentially detectable in the next decade.
This is one of the theory's strongest and most testable predictions -- dark matter as leaked geometry, not new particles.
