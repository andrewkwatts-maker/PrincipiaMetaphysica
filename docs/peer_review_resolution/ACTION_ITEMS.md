## [1] Ab Initio Derivation of b3=24

```
IMPLEMENTATION: Code changes or documentation updates needed**

*   **Documentation:**  The primary change is in the documentation.  The current documentation needs to be completely rewritten to:

    *   Explicitly state the chosen G2 manifold and its defining properties.
    *   Present the derivation of `b3 = 24` (or a clear explanation of why a derivation is not currently possible).
    *   Clearly state any assumptions or approximations made in the derivation.
    *   Add citations to relevant mathematical literature (e.g., Joyce's papers, topology textbooks).

*   **Code:** The code itself might not need changes if `b3` is simply a constant. However, if the framework relies on numerical calculations related to the G2 manifold, those calculations need to be verified and made reproduci...
