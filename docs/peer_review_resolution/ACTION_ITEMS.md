## [1] Ab Initio Derivation of b3=24

```
IMPLEMENTATION: Code changes or documentation updates needed**

*   **Documentation:**  The primary change is in the documentation.  The current documentation needs to be completely rewritten to:

    *   Explicitly state the chosen G2 manifold and its defining properties.
    *   Present the derivation of `b3 = 24` (or a clear explanation of why a derivation is not currently possible).
    *   Clearly state any assumptions or approximations made in the derivation.
    *   Add citations to relevant mathematical literature (e.g., Joyce's papers, topology textbooks).

*   **Code:** The code itself might not need changes if `b3` is simply a constant. However, if the framework relies on numerical calculations related to the G2 manifold, those calculations need to be verified and made reproduci...

## [2] Justify Two-Time (24,2) Signature [HISTORICAL - See v21+]

**Note (v23.0)**: The (24,2) signature was used in v16-v20. The v21+ framework uses 25D(24,1) with Euclidean bridge pairs. See Appendix G for the current architecture.

- [x] Review Gemini recommendations - SUPERSEDED by v21+ refactor
- [x] Implement changes - Replaced with (24,1) framework
- [x] Validate fixes - v21+ passes all validation
