SUB-TOPIC 01: Two-Layer OR Reduction Structure
================================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
The theory contains TWO hierarchically distinct Objective Reduction (OR) layers:

Layer 1 — Bridge/Global OR (Higher-Level):
- Operator: R_⊥^global = ⊗_{i=1}^{12} R_{⊥,i}, with R_{⊥,i}² = -I (Möbius double-cover per bridge pair)
- Domain: Acts on the full 27D bulk BEFORE any compactification
- Effect: Creates and maintains the two 13D shadows from the 27D bulk
- The 12 bridge pairs (Euclidean C^(2,0) directions) provide the tensor product structure

Layer 2 — Face/Local OR (Lower-Level):
- Operator: R_face^(f) = exp(-iλ_f t/b₃) · R_OR
- Eigenvalues: λ_f = (n_f / (c₇ Vol))^{2/7} (from Dirac spectrum on G₂)
- Domain: Acts AFTER shadows exist — operates independently in each 13D shadow on its moduli wavefunction
- Effect: Selects the dominant visible face (1 of 4 Kähler moduli sectors per shadow)

Hierarchical Nesting:
|Ψ_bulk⟩ →[R_⊥^global]→ |Ψ₁⟩ ⊗ |Ψ₂⟩ →[R_face^(f₁) ⊗ R_face^(f₂)]→ |Ψ_vis,1⟩ ⊗ |Ψ_vis,2⟩

Non-commutativity proof: R_face ∘ R_⊥^global ≠ R_⊥^global ∘ R_face
(Shadows must exist before faces can be selected.)

KEY FORMULAS:
- R_⊥^global = ⊗_{i=1}^{12} R_{⊥,i}
- R_face^(f) = exp(-iλ_f t / b₃) · R_OR
- λ_f = (n_f / (c₇ √6))^{2/7}

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Create new simulation formalizing the two-layer OR structure
2. Register both OR operators as formal mathematical objects
3. Prove hierarchical nesting and non-commutativity
4. Add section content explaining bridge OR vs face OR
5. Connect to existing geometric_anchors.py and four_face_structure.py

AFFECTED SIMULATIONS:
- simulations/PM/geometry/four_face_structure.py (already has face OR hints)
- simulations/PM/geometry/geometric_anchors.py (bridge structure)
- simulations/PM/field_dynamics/orch_or_bridge.py (OR mechanism)
- simulations/PM/support/bridge_pressure.py (bridge physics)
