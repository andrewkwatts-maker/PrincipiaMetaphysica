SUB-TOPIC 02: Bridge Warping Potential (V_bridge)
===================================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
The bridge warping potential V_bridge governs shadow creation/separation (Layer 1 OR).
It is the effective potential for decompactification of the 12 bridge pairs.

EXPLICIT FORMULA:
V_bridge = Σ_{i=1}^{12} Λ_i exp(-a_i T_{bridge,i}) + (T_ω²/2)(χ_eff/b₃) + κ Σ_{i=1}^{12} |∇T_{bridge,i}|²

Where:
- T_{bridge,i}: Size of i-th bridge pair (2,0 directions)
- a_i = b₃/i = 24/i (flux-induced exponential from 3-cycle threading)
- Λ_i ~ (∫F∧φ)_i = 6/12 = 0.5 (flux per bridge pair)
- T_ω = √(b₃/χ_eff) = 1/√6 ≈ 0.408 (bridge torsion/pressure mismatch)
- χ_eff/b₃ = 6 (effective density from flux quantization)
- κ ~ 1/Vol(V₇) = 1/√6 (normalization from G₂ volume)

WARPING STRENGTH PER BRIDGE:
α_warp^(i) = exp(-T_{bridge,i}/T_core) · (1 + T_ω²)^{-1/2}

GOD-LEVEL LIMIT (maximal unification):
lim_{T_{bridge,i} → ∞ ∀i} V_bridge → 0 ⟹ shadows merge (full unification)

KEY PROPERTIES:
1. Racetrack structure: exponential stabilization from flux threading
2. Torsion quadratic: T_ω²/2 · χ_eff/b₃ provides minimum energy
3. Kinetic term: κ|∇T|² normalizes moduli fluctuations
4. All coefficients derived from topology (b₃=24, χ_eff=144, flux=6)

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Add V_bridge formula to master action simulation
2. Register bridge warping parameters (T_bridge, α_warp, Λ_i)
3. Compute numerical warping values for all 12 bridges
4. Add section content explaining God-level unification limit
5. Connect to existing bridge_pressure.py and lagrangian_master.py
