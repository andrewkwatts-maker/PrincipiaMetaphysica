SUB-TOPIC 04: Updated Master Lagrangian (Both OR Layers)
==========================================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
The master action must now explicitly distinguish both OR layers by including separate
warping potential terms for bridge and face reduction.

FULL 27D BULK ACTION:
S = ∫_{M^27} √(-g) [ R + Ψ̄_P iγ^M(D_M + T_ω^M)Ψ_P + |∂Φ_M|² - V(Φ_M)
    + (1/24)∫F∧φ + Σ_{n=1}^{125} R_n ψ̄_n D̸ψ_n - ln(Vol(V₇)) dt_phys
    + V_bridge^(global OR) + Σ_{f=1}^{4} V_face^(f)(local OR) ]

Where (unchanged shared terms):
- R: 27D Ricci scalar (emergent from g_MN = ⟨Ψ_P Γ_MN Ψ_P⟩)
- D_M = ∂_M + (1/4)ω_MAB Γ^AB + T_ω^M (covariant derivative with torsion T_ω ≈ 1/√6)
- V(Φ_M) = Σ_{i=1}^{4} Λ_i exp(-a_i Φ_M) + Λ₀ (racetrack, a_i = b₃/i)
- Flux: ∫F∧φ = χ_eff/24 = 6
- Residues: R_n = exp(-λ_n/b₃) (125 constants from G₂ Laplacian)
- Thermal time: -ln(Vol) dt_phys

NEW TERMS:
- V_bridge^(global OR): Controls shadow creation/separation (God limit)
- Σ V_face^(f)(local OR): Controls face selection per shadow (Human limit)

REDUCED LAGRANGIANS (after each OR layer):

13D per-shadow (after bridge OR):
S_13D = ∫√(-g_13) [R_13 + Ψ̄_P iγ^m(∂_m + T_ω^m)Ψ_P + V_face^(f)(local OR)]

4D effective (after face OR in dominant face):
L_4D = -(M_Pl²/2)R_4 + χ̄ iD̸χ + |D_μ φ|² - V(φ) + (1/4)F_μν^a F^aμν + y_f ψ̄φψ + Λ + ...
with: M_Pl² = M_*^11 Vol(V₇), Λ = (∫F∧φ)²/Vol ≈ 10^{-52} m^{-2}

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Update lagrangian_master.py to include V_bridge + V_face terms
2. Add 13D and 4D reduced Lagrangian formulas
3. Register the full master action with both OR layers
4. Add section content explaining the hierarchical reduction chain
5. Ensure all terms remain sterile (no free parameters)

AFFECTED SIMULATIONS:
- simulations/PM/derivations/lagrangian_master.py (primary)
- simulations/PM/gauge/master_action.py (secondary)
- simulations/PM/derivations/gauge_sector_complete.py
- simulations/PM/derivations/gr_spacetime.py
