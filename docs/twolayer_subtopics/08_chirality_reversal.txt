SUB-TOPIC 08: Chirality Reversal Mechanism
=============================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
The dual-shadow structure naturally reverses chirality: Shadow 1 is left-chiral (our world),
Shadow 2 is right-chiral (mirror). The chirality reversal operator combines both OR layers.

CHIRALITY REVERSAL OPERATOR:
R_chirality = R_⊥^global · P_{L/R} · R_face^(f)

Where:
- R_⊥^global: Bridge OR (creates shadow duality, flips chirality)
- P_{L/R}: Chiral projection operator (selects left or right handedness)
- R_face^(f): Face OR (selects visible sector within shadow)

CHIRALITY FLIP PROBABILITY:
P_reverse ≈ 3 × 10^{-6}

This is the probability that a left-handed particle in Shadow 1 appears right-handed
in Shadow 2 through bridge tunneling.

MIRROR SHADOW PROPERTIES:
- Shadow 1 (our world): Left-chiral weak force (SU(2)_L)
- Shadow 2 (mirror): Right-chiral weak force (SU(2)_R)
- Both shadows share: same speed of light, same gravity, same timeline
- Euclidean bridge (C^(2,0)): Timeless connector, Möbius twist reverses chirality

PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS:
1. The weak force looks different in the mirror shadow (right-handed)
2. Strong force, EM, and gravity are identical in both shadows
3. CPT is preserved globally across both shadows
4. The chirality reversal is topological — encoded in the Möbius structure of R_⊥

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Add chirality reversal formula to orch_or_bridge.py or new simulation
2. Register R_chirality operator and P_reverse ≈ 3×10^{-6}
3. Document mirror shadow chirality properties
4. Add section content explaining CPT preservation across shadows
5. Connect to existing neutrino_mixing.py (cross-shadow PMNS)

AFFECTED SIMULATIONS:

- simulations/PM/particle/neutrino_mixing.py
- simulations/PM/gauge/master_action.py
- simulations/PM/support/bridge_pressure.py
