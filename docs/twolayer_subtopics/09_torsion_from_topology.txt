SUB-TOPIC 09: Torsion from Topology (T_ω Derivation)
======================================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
Torsion T_ω is not postulated — it emerges as a topological invariant of the bridge
structure and G₂ manifold. The derivation is purely geometric in 4 steps.

FINAL FORMULA:
T_ω = √(b₃/χ_eff) = 1/√6 ≈ 0.408

DERIVATION (4 Steps):

Step 1. Torsion as non-integrability of G₂ 3-form
Under flux and bridge warping (weak G₂ structure):
∇φ = T_ω ∧ φ
Magnitude |T_ω| measures deviation from torsion-free G₂.

Step 2. Topological imbalance source
Bridge pressure arises from ratio of independent 3-cycles to total topology:
|T_ω| ∝ √(b₃/χ_eff) = √(transverse modes / total complexity)

Step 3. Flux quantization normalizes exactly
∫F∧φ = χ_eff/24 = 6 → proportionality constant = 1

Step 4. No further corrections needed
Volume Vol = √(χ_eff/b₃), spectral gap k_gimel = 12+1/π, and shadows cancel:
T_ω = √(b₃/χ_eff) = √(24/144) = 1/√6

PHYSICAL ROLES:
- Covariant derivative: D_M = ∂_M + (1/4)ω_MAB Γ^AB + T_ω^M
- GW dispersion: η ≈ T_ω/π ≈ 0.13
- Portal leakage: α_leak ~ 1/√6 ≈ 0.577 → 0.57 (flux-tuned)
- DE thawing: w₀ = -1 + 1/b₃ = -23/24 (bridge pressure via torsion)
- Bridge warping: V_bridge contains T_ω²/2 · χ_eff/b₃ term
- Face warping: V_face contains T_ω²/2 · exp(-T/T_max) term

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Enhance torsion derivation documentation in geometric_anchors.py
2. Add the 4-step derivation as explicit section content
3. Register T_ω = 1/√6 with full topological justification
4. Cross-reference all physical roles (GW, portal, DE, warping)
5. Ensure torsion appears consistently across all affected simulations
