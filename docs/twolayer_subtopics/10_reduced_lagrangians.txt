SUB-TOPIC 10: Reduced Lagrangians (13D per-shadow, 4D effective)
=================================================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
After each OR layer, the master action reduces to lower-dimensional effective theories.
This gives a clear chain: 27D → 13D (bridge OR) → 4D (face OR).

REDUCTION CHAIN:

27D Bulk (full master action):
S = ∫_{M^27} √(-g) [R + ... + V_bridge + Σ V_face^(f)]

→ Bridge/Global OR (Layer 1) →

13D Per-Shadow Lagrangian:
S_13D = ∫ √(-g_13) [R_13 + Ψ̄_P iγ^m(∂_m + T_ω^m)Ψ_P + V_face^(f)(local OR)]

Key: After bridge OR, each shadow inherits the face OR potential.
The 14 Euclidean bridge dimensions (12×(2,0) + C^(2,0)) are integrated out.

→ Face/Local OR (Layer 2) →

4D Effective Lagrangian:
L_4D = -(M_Pl²/2)R_4 + χ̄ iD̸χ + |D_μ φ|² - V(φ) + (1/4)F_μν^a F^aμν + y_f ψ̄φψ + Λ + ...

With:
- M_Pl² = M_*^{11} Vol(V₇) (Planck mass from extra-dimensional volume)
- Λ = (∫F∧φ)²/Vol ≈ 10^{-52} m^{-2} (cosmological constant from flux)

DIMENSIONALITY ACCOUNTING:
- 27D total = 4D visible + 7D G₂ core + 14D bridges + 2D central bridge
- After bridge OR: 13D = 4D visible + 7D G₂ core + 2D residual
- After face OR: 4D visible (all internal dimensions compactified)

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Add 13D per-shadow Lagrangian formula to lagrangian_master.py
2. Add explicit 4D effective Lagrangian with M_Pl and Λ expressions
3. Document the reduction chain as section content
4. Verify dimensional accounting (27→13→4)
5. Connect to KK reduction simulation (appendix_o)
