SUB-TOPIC 12: Falsifiability & Paper Strengthening
=====================================================
Source: TwoLayerOR And Dark Forces.txt

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
The two-layer OR structure strengthens the theory's falsifiability claims and requires
updates to the paper's abstract, introduction, and predictions sections.

FALSIFIABILITY CRITERIA (existing + new):
1. Proton lifetime: τ_p > 10^{34} years (existing, from GUT constraint)
2. GW dispersion: η ≈ 0.10–0.13 (existing, from torsion T_ω/π)
3. Dark energy EOS: w₀ = -23/24 ≈ -0.9583 (existing, DESI-compatible)
4. Neutrino mass ordering: Normal hierarchy (existing)
5. NEW: Dark light leakage: P_leak ~ 10^{-5}–10^{-6} (testable in quantum optics)
6. NEW: Cross-shadow phase shift: Δφ ~ 10^{-6}–10^{-8} rad
7. NEW: Dark force hierarchy: Strong=0, Weak=0, EM~10^{-3}, Gravity~10^{-3}
8. NEW: Chirality reversal: P_reverse ≈ 3×10^{-6}

GHOST-FREE CLAIM:
The theory claims ghost-free propagation (BRST cohomology) because:
- All terms in the master action are derived from topology
- No free parameters → no ghost degrees of freedom
- Two OR layers are hierarchically nested and non-commuting
- V_bridge and V_face are positive-definite racetrack potentials

PAPER UPDATES NEEDED:
1. Abstract: Mention two-layer OR structure and dark force predictions
2. Introduction: Frame the dual-layer collapse as central organizing principle
3. Predictions section: Add dark force leakage observables table
4. Discussion: Address dark motor impossibility and communication limits
5. Conclusions: Strengthen falsifiability claims with new predictions

PROPOSED CHANGES:
1. Update abstract.py section content to mention two OR layers
2. Update predictions.py with dark force observables
3. Add falsifiability criteria to validation simulations
4. Document ghost-free proof in methodology section
5. Ensure all new predictions are registered as formal predictions
