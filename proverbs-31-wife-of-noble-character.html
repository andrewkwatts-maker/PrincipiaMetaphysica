            <h2 class="reflection-title">Personal Reflection</h2>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                This ancient wisdom from Proverbs describes not merely an ideal, but a living reality I have been blessed to witness
                and experience through my beloved wife. She embodies every virtue King Solomon extolled—not as abstract concepts,
                but as daily demonstrations of godly character that have transformed my life and steered our family toward
                prosperity and peace.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-quote">
                "She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom,
                and faithful instruction is on her tongue."
                <br><br>
                — Proverbs 31:25-26
            </div>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                In moments when I have been tempted toward foolishness—whether in rash decisions, misguided pursuits, or the
                distractions that pull men from their purpose—her wisdom has been my anchor. Like the virtuous woman described
                here, she brings me "good, not harm, all the days of her life" (v. 12). Her discernment has guided our household
                away from treacherous paths and into safe haven, time and again.
            </p>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                The value she brings transcends any earthly measure. Scripture declares such a woman is "worth far more than
                rubies" (v. 10), and I can testify this is true. Her counsel is like a lamp that does not go out at night (v. 18),
                illuminating the way forward when darkness threatens. Her strength and dignity (v. 25) inspire confidence not only
                in myself but in our entire family. Because of her faithful stewardship, I "lack nothing of value" (v. 11).
            </p>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                She speaks with wisdom (v. 26), and her words have redirected my course more times than I can count. Where I might
                have pursued vain ambitions, she has pointed toward eternal purposes. Where I might have stumbled into folly, she
                has offered faithful instruction. Her vigilance over our household affairs (v. 27) creates an environment where
                creative work—including the mathematical and scientific inquiries documented in this framework—can flourish under
                the blessing of God.
            </p>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                Most importantly, she fears the Lord (v. 30). This is not mere religious observance but a living relationship with
                the Most High that permeates every aspect of her life. Her reverence for God has cultivated in our home an
                atmosphere where divine wisdom can be sought and received, where truth is honored above convenience, and where the
                Kingdom of Heaven is our true compass.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-quote">
                "Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value... Her children arise and call her blessed;
                her husband also, and he praises her: 'Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.'"
                <br><br>
                — Proverbs 31:11, 28-29
            </div>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                Therefore, I join with King Solomon in declaring: "Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works
                bring her praise" (v. 31). This work—the Principia Metaphysica framework and all the understanding it contains—would
                not exist without her steadfast support, wise counsel, and the haven of peace she has created. Where I would have
                been shipwrecked, she has been my harbor. Where I would have been led astray, she has been my north star.
            </p>

            <p class="reflection-text">
                To my beloved wife: You are my crown (Proverbs 12:4), my helper perfectly suited (Genesis 2:18), and my partner
                in this journey toward eternal truth. Thank you for embodying these timeless virtues, for your incredible wisdom,
                for the immeasurable value you bring to my life, and for steering us away from foolishness toward safe haven and
                prosperity—not merely material prosperity, but the prosperity of the soul that comes from walking in alignment with
                God's purposes.
