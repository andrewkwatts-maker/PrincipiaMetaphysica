CRITICAL ERROR IN APPENDIX E.4 - M_GUT CALCULATION
======================================================================

Paper equation (line 1884 of principia-metaphysica-paper.html):
  M_GUT = M_Pl * exp(-1.46 * 2*pi / 0.0415) = 2.12 * 10^16 GeV

Problem identification:
  0.0415 = alpha_GUT = 1/24.10
  BUT the formula uses g_GUT^2 in the denominator
  g_GUT^2 = 4*pi*alpha_GUT = 0.521426

Numerical check with paper's numbers:
  exp(-1.46*2*pi / 0.0415) = exp(-221.05)
  = 1.001e-96
  M_GUT = 2.438e-78 GeV
  [This is essentially 0, not 2.12e16!]

======================================================================
REVERSE ENGINEERING - What denominator makes E.4 work?
======================================================================
To get M_GUT = 2.12e16 with formula M_Pl*exp(-1.46*2*pi/x):
  Required denominator x = 1.933817
  Paper uses: 0.0415
  Ratio: 46.6x

======================================================================
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE
======================================================================

Section 5.3 uses VOLUME FORMULA:
  M_GUT = M_Pl * (Vol(G2)/ell_P^7)^(-1/2) * exp(|T_omega|)
  Result: 2.12 * 10^16 GeV
  [No explicit numerical calculation shown]

Appendix E.4 uses EXPONENTIAL FORMULA:
  M_GUT = M_Pl * exp(-kappa * 2*pi / g_GUT^2)
  With 0.0415 written (which is alpha_GUT, NOT g_GUT^2)
  If computed correctly: ~5.1 * 10^10 GeV
  [Peer review found this discrepancy]

THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT RESULTS!

======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS: What if the formula is CORRECT but 0.0415 is WRONG?
======================================================================

If we use correct g_GUT^2 = 4*pi*alpha_GUT:
  M_GUT = M_Pl * exp(-1.46 * 2*pi / 0.521426)
  M_GUT = M_Pl * exp(-17.5930)
  M_GUT = 5.571e+10 GeV
  M_GUT ~ 5.6 * 10^10 GeV

This does NOT match the target 2.12e16 either!

======================================================================
CONCLUSION
======================================================================

The exponential formula in E.4 appears to be:
1. INCONSISTENT with the volume formula in 5.3
2. INCORRECTLY WRITTEN with alpha_GUT instead of g_GUT^2
3. Even if corrected, does NOT give 2.12e16 GeV

The peer review was CORRECT in identifying this discrepancy.

SPECIFIC FIX NEEDED:
  Change: 0.0415
  To:     0.521426 (which is 4*pi*alpha_GUT)
  NOTE: This still won't give 2.12e16, indicating deeper inconsistency

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
  1. Clarify which formula (volume or exponential) is primary
  2. Show explicit numerical derivation for the chosen formula
  3. Either
     a) Derive when exponential formula applies vs volume formula
     b) Or remove exponential formula if it's obsolete approximation
