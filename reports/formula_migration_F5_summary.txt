Section 6 demonstrates the power of geometric Yukawa couplings from G₂
manifolds. The PMNS predictions are among the best in the paper, with
average deviation 0.3σ. The fermion mass predictions are extraordinary,
especially the tau mass (0.01% error).

The missing theta12/theta13 Formula objects and CP phase inconsistency
are straightforward to fix. Overall, this is one of the strongest
sections of the paper.
