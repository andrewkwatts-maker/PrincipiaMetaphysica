  "theoretical_significance": "The third Betti number b₃ = 24 is the most important topological invariant in Principia Metaphysica. It counts the number of independent 3-cycles (associative submanifolds) in the G₂ manifold. For twisted connected sum (TCS) G₂ manifolds built from K3 surfaces, b₃ = b₂(K3) + 2 = 22 + 2 = 24. This single number determines: (1) Three fermion generations: N_gen = b₃/8 = 3, (2) Dark energy equation of state: w₀ = -1 + 1/b₃ = -23/24, (3) Dark energy evolution: w_a = -1/√b₃ = -0.204, (4) Euler characteristic: χ = 144 = 6·b₃, (5) Neutrino mass sum: Σm_ν = k_gimel/(2π·b₃). The fact that b₃ = 24 matches the Monster group connection (24 = dimension of minimal representation) hints at deep mathematical structure.",
