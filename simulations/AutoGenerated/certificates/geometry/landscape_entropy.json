  "theoretical_significance": "The string landscape problem posits ~10^500 possible vacua, leading to an entropic measure problem. PM resolves this: the G2 holonomy condition with b3=24 and chi_eff=144 uniquely selects ONE vacuum. The landscape entropy S ~ 500 (in log_10 units) is reduced to S_eff = 0. This is anthropic principle replaced by geometric selection: there is only one consistent vacuum, and we inhabit it.",
