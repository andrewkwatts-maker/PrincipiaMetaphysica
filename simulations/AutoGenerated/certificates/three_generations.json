  "theoretical_significance": "The number of generations is not a free parameter but a topological invariant of the G₂ manifold. The index theorem for G₂ manifolds counts chiral zero modes: index(D_fermion) = (1/2)∫ A-hat(M₇) = b₃/8. For TCS G₂ manifolds with b₃ = 24, this gives exactly 3 generations. The saturation condition N_gen × 8 = b₃ means all 24 harmonic 3-forms are occupied by fermion wavefunctions, explaining why we have neither 2 nor 4 generations. This is a parameter-free, purely geometric prediction that matches Nature exactly.",
