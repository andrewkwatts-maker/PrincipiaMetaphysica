Derives fermion chirality from G2 holonomy and spinorial representations.
This simulation implements the complete chirality mechanism in PM theory.

KEY PHYSICS:
- G2 holonomy preserves exactly 1 real spinor (η) in 7D
- Associative 4-form Φ defines chirality projector: P_L = (1 + *Φ)/2
- Dirac operator ∂/ = γ^μ D_μ has chiral zero modes
- Chirality index theorem: n_L - n_R = ∫ Φ ∧ dΦ / (2π)^3
- Connection to 3 generations via spinor saturation

PHYSICAL PICTURE:
- G2 manifolds are spin manifolds admitting parallel spinors
- Holonomy G2 ⊂ Spin(7) preserves 1 of 8 real spinor components
- 4-form associative calibration Φ induces chirality structure
- Zero modes of Dirac operator localize on associative 3-cycles
- Index formula relates chirality imbalance to topology (χ_eff = 144)
- Saturation: 24 flux units / 8 spinor DOF = 3 generations

DERIVATION CHAIN:
topology.chi_eff = 144 (TCS G2 manifold #187)
topology.b3 = 24 (third Betti number)
  -> spinor components = 8 (Spin(7) representation)
  -> preserved spinors = 1 (G2 holonomy)
  -> chiral index = χ_eff / 24 = 6
  -> n_L - n_R = 6 per cycle
  -> n_gen = b3 / spinor_DOF = 24 / 8 = 3

                "left-handed and right-handed, like left and right gloves. This is called "
                "chirality. The weak force only talks to left-handed particles, which is "
                "super weird! Why? In this theory, it's because the hidden 7D space has "
                "G2 geometry, which naturally picks out one special 'direction' for spinors "
                "(quantum spin states). This creates a built-in asymmetry that forces "
                "particles to have definite handedness. The math predicts exactly 3 "

                "Imagine you're in a house where all the doors are designed for right-handed "
                "people (handles on the left when you approach). Left-handed people can still "
                "use them, but it's awkward. The G2 geometry is like that house - it's "
                "'built' with a preference for one handedness. Specifically, G2 preserves "
                "exactly 1 'master key' spinor (out of 8 possible) that defines what "
                "'left-handed' means everywhere in the space. When particles propagate through "
                "this geometry, they naturally split into left and right versions, with the "
                "left ones 'fitting' better with the master spinor. The 4-form Φ acts like "
