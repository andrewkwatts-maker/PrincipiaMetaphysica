\section*{Data Availability Statement}

All simulations, derivations, and numerical results presented in this work are publicly available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/andrewkwatts-maker/PrincipiaMetaphysica} (v12.0-final-truth). The repository contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item Complete Python simulation code for all v9.0--v12.0 calculations
\item Configuration file (\texttt{config.py}) defining all geometric parameters from TCS G$_2$ manifold \#187
\item Simulation output (\texttt{theory\_output.json}) with all derived numerical values
\item Website source code with interactive visualizations
\item Complete derivation documentation
\end{itemize}

No proprietary, restricted, or non-public data were used. All experimental comparison data (PDG 2024, DESI DR2, Planck 2018, Super-Kamiokande) are publicly available from the cited sources. The framework is based on publicly available mathematical structures (TCS G$_2$ manifolds from Corti et al., arXiv:1809.09083) with zero fitted parameters.

This work is made available under standard academic open-access principles to ensure reproducibility and enable independent verification of all claims.
