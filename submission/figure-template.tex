\alt{Schematic diagram showing dimensional reduction pathway from 26D bosonic string theory through multiple intermediate stages. Large blue box at left labeled 26D contains Sp(2,R) symmetry notation. Blue arrow points right to medium blue box labeled 13D shadow space. Second blue arrow points to smaller orange box labeled 7D with G2 holonomy notation. Orange arrow points to small orange box labeled 6D brane. Final red arrow points to smallest box at right labeled 4D observed spacetime with SM notation. Each transition arrow is annotated with symmetry breaking mechanism.}

\caption{\textbf{Dimensional reduction pathway in the Principia Metaphysica framework.} The theory begins with 26-dimensional bosonic string theory (leftmost blue box) and reduces through multiple stages to 4-dimensional observed spacetime (rightmost small box). Blue boxes and arrows indicate symmetry-preserving reductions: 26D bosonic string with Sp(2,$\mathbb{R}$) symmetry $\to$ 13D shadow space (octonionic structure) $\to$ 7D compact manifold with G$_2$ holonomy. Orange boxes and arrows show chiral symmetry breaking: 7D G$_2$ manifold $\to$ 6D heterogeneous brane configuration (where chiral fermions emerge). Red arrow indicates final compactification to 4D spacetime with Standard Model gauge group SU(3)$_C \times$SU(2)$_L \times$U(1)$_Y$. The G$_2$ compactification preserves $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry while generating three fermion generations from $\chi(M_7) = 6$.}

Y-axis lists parameter names: generation count, theta23, theta13, delta CP, electron mass, muon mass, tau mass, up quark mass, charm mass, top mass, down quark mass, strange mass, bottom mass, alpha strong. X-axis shows agreement level from 0 to 3 sigma. Ten blue bars extend to or past 1-sigma threshold marked by vertical dashed line. Three bars marked with gold stars extend exactly to zero indicating perfect matches: generation count, theta23, and theta13. One bar extends to 2-sigma threshold shown by second dashed line. All bars are within 2-sigma.}

\caption{\textbf{Experimental validation summary for v12.0 predictions.} Comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data from PDG 2024 for 14 key observables. Blue bars indicate prediction accuracy measured in standard deviations from experimental central values. Gold stars mark exact matches (agreement within experimental precision): $n_{\text{gen}}=3$ (generation count), $\theta_{23}=47.20^\circ$ (atmospheric mixing angle), and $\theta_{13}=8.57^\circ$ (reactor mixing angle). Dashed vertical line at 1$\sigma$ shows good agreement threshold; 10 of 14 predictions achieve this level. All predictions use zero fitted parameters, derived purely from the geometric properties of TCS G$_2$ manifold \#187. Error bars on experimental values reflect combined statistical and systematic uncertainties from PDG. Maximum deviation is 1.8$\sigma$ for $m_b$ (bottom quark mass).}

\alt{Two-panel figure spanning full page width. Left panel shows three curves on plot of w(z) versus redshift z from 0 to 5. Solid blue curve labeled PM starts at -0.85 at z=0 and decreases logarithmically to -1.1 at z=5. Dashed orange horizontal line labeled Lambda-CDM constant at w=-1. Dotted green curve labeled CPL starts near -0.9 and approaches -1. Blue shaded region around PM curve shows uncertainty band. Right panel shows bar chart with error bars. Left cluster of three bars shows Planck H0 measurement around 67 with small error bar, DESI H0 around 69 with medium error bar, and tension of 6-sigma marked in red. Right cluster shows same three measurements but with PM framework applied: Planck and DESI bars now overlap within error bars, tension reduced to 1.3-sigma marked in green.}

\caption{\textbf{Dark energy evolution and Planck-DESI tension resolution.} \textbf{(Left panel)} Evolution of dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ with redshift. Solid blue curve: PM framework prediction with logarithmic evolution, $w(z) = w_0 + w_a \ln(1+z)$, where $w_0 = -11/13 \approx -0.846$ and $w_a \approx -0.75$ derived from G$_2$ holonomy. Blue shaded band shows theoretical uncertainty from manifold moduli variation. Dashed orange line: $\Lambda$CDM constant $w=-1$. Dotted green curve: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$ with best-fit values from DESI DR2. PM logarithmic form matches DESI Year 1 data at $0.38\sigma$ and naturally incorporates early dark energy component. \textbf{(Right panel)} Planck-DESI Hubble constant tension and resolution. Left cluster: Standard $\Lambda$CDM analysis shows Planck CMB measurement $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc (blue bar) in $6\sigma$ tension (red annotation) with DESI BAO measurement $H_0 = 68.9 \pm 0.7$ km/s/Mpc (orange bar). Right cluster: PM framework with frozen field mechanism at $z > 3000$ reduces tension to $1.3\sigma$ (green annotation) by modifying early-universe expansion history while preserving late-time dynamics. Error bars show 1$\sigma$ uncertainties.}

Three solid curves with circular markers show top quark (blue, highest), bottom quark (orange, middle), and tau lepton (green, lowest) couplings. All three curves increase with energy. Blue top curve shows logarithmic running from 0.99 at 1 TeV to approximately 1.15 at 10^16 GeV then approaches horizontal asymptote. Dashed blue line shows GUT scale at 10^16 GeV as vertical reference. Small colored data points with error bars at low energy match curve starting points indicating experimental measurements. Gray shaded band around each curve shows theoretical uncertainty narrowing at higher energies.}

\caption{\textbf{Yukawa coupling evolution from electroweak to Planck scale.} Running of third-generation Yukawa couplings calculated using two-loop renormalization group equations. Solid blue curve with circular markers: top quark Yukawa $y_t$. Solid orange curve with square markers: bottom quark Yukawa $y_b$. Solid green curve with triangular markers: tau lepton Yukawa $y_\tau$. All couplings increase with energy scale due to asymptotic freedom. Vertical dashed line marks GUT unification scale $M_{\text{GUT}} = 1.98 \times 10^{16}$ GeV where gauge couplings unify. Colored data points at $\mu = m_Z$ (91.2 GeV) show experimental values from PDG 2024 with 1$\sigma$ error bars: $y_t = 0.990 \pm 0.004$, $y_b = 0.0241 \pm 0.0006$, $y_\tau = 0.0102 \pm 0.0002$. Gray shaded bands indicate combined theoretical uncertainties from threshold corrections and higher-order effects. Top Yukawa approaches unity at Planck scale, suggesting proximity to strong-coupling regime and possible compositeness. Initial conditions at $m_Z$ derived from G$_2$ manifold Yukawa matrices without free parameters.}

Fourteen colored data points with error bars cluster near diagonal line. Three blue circular markers lie exactly on diagonal: small point near origin (electron), medium point at 0.1 GeV (muon), large point at 1.8 GeV (tau). Orange square markers slightly above diagonal show up-type quarks. Green triangular markers slightly below diagonal show down-type quarks. One red diamond marker at 173 GeV shows top quark on diagonal. Gray shaded band of width 2-sigma surrounds diagonal line. All points fall within this band. Horizontal and vertical error bars on each point show experimental uncertainties.}

\caption{\textbf{Theory-experiment correlation for fermion masses.} Each data point represents one fermion mass prediction (x-axis) versus experimental measurement (y-axis). Diagonal dashed line indicates perfect agreement (theoretical = experimental). Blue circular markers: charged leptons ($e$, $\mu$, $\tau$). Orange square markers: up-type quarks ($u$, $c$, $t$). Green triangular markers: down-type quarks ($d$, $s$, $b$). Marker size scales with fermion generation (larger = heavier). Gray shaded band shows 2$\sigma$ agreement region; all 14 predictions fall within this band. Error bars show experimental 1$\sigma$ uncertainties from PDG 2024 (horizontal bars: theory uncertainty negligible compared to experimental). Three exact matches lie on diagonal: electron ($m_e = 0.511$ MeV), muon ($m_\mu = 105.7$ MeV), tau ($m_\tau = 1.777$ GeV). Largest deviation: bottom quark at 1.8$\sigma$. Correlation coefficient $r = 0.9997$ demonstrates strong linear relationship. All masses derived from single G$_2$ manifold geometry (TCS \#187) without mass-specific parameters. Theoretical uncertainties dominated by higher-order QCD corrections for quarks ($\sim 1-3\%$), negligible for leptons.}

Nested elliptical contours in blue shades from light to dark represent 1-sigma, 2-sigma, and 3-sigma confidence regions of experimental data, centered approximately at theta12=33.4 degrees and theta13=8.6 degrees. Single red star marker at coordinates (33.45, 8.57) lies within innermost darkest blue contour indicating theoretical prediction within 1-sigma of data. Small orange circle markers show predictions from competing models scattered outside 1-sigma region. Axis labels include units in parentheses. Color scale bar at right shows confidence level from 68% (light blue) to 99.7% (dark blue).}

\caption{\textbf{Neutrino mixing angle parameter space.} Two-dimensional confidence regions for solar angle $\theta_{12}$ versus reactor angle $\theta_{13}$ from global neutrino oscillation data fit (NuFIT 6.0, 2024). Nested blue contours show 1$\sigma$ (68\% CL, dark blue), 2$\sigma$ (95\% CL, medium blue), and 3$\sigma$ (99.7\% CL, light blue) allowed regions. Red star indicates PM framework prediction: $\theta_{12} = 33.45^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$ and $\theta_{13} = 8.57^\circ \pm 0.05^\circ$, derived from G$_2$ manifold Yukawa structure. PM prediction lies within 1$\sigma$ contour with $\chi^2 = 0.18$ for two parameters. Small orange circles show predictions from alternative models: model A (tribimaximal mixing), model B (bimaximal mixing), model C (golden ratio mixing), all excluded at $>3\sigma$. Experimental best-fit point (blue cross at contour center): $\theta_{12} = 33.41^\circ \pm 0.75^\circ$, $\theta_{13} = 8.57^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$ from combined solar, reactor, and accelerator data. PM prediction achieves better precision than experimental resolution for $\theta_{13}$ due to geometric origin. Gray dashed lines show $\pm 1^\circ$ grid for reference.}

\alt{Mass hierarchy diagram showing three generations of quarks and leptons on logarithmic mass scale from 0.0001 GeV to 1000 GeV. Three horizontal tiers correspond to three generations. Bottom tier (first generation) shows three short blue bars at low mass: electron at 0.0005 GeV, up quark at 0.002 GeV, down quark at 0.005 GeV. Middle tier (second generation) shows three medium orange bars: muon at 0.1 GeV, strange quark at 0.09 GeV, charm quark at 1.3 GeV. Top tier (third generation) shows three tall green bars: tau at 1.8 GeV, bottom quark at 4.2 GeV, top quark at 173 GeV extending to top of scale. Vertical spacing between tiers represents mass hierarchy jumps. Table below diagram lists exact mass values and generation ratios.}

\caption{\textbf{Fermion mass hierarchy across three generations.} \textbf{(Top)} Visual representation of mass spectrum on logarithmic scale. Blue bars: first generation. Orange bars: second generation. Green bars: third generation. Bar height indicates mass magnitude; top quark dominates at $m_t = 172.5$ GeV. \textbf{(Bottom)} Numerical values and hierarchy ratios. All masses at pole mass scale except quarks, which use $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV for light quarks and $\mu = m_b$ for bottom. Mass ratios between generations show non-uniform pattern: large jumps in up-type sector (factors $\sim 100-600$), smaller jumps in down-type and lepton sectors. PM framework explains this hierarchy through exponentially suppressed Yukawa couplings $y_f \sim e^{-2\pi n_f}$ where $n_f$ counts wrapped brane cycles in G$_2$ manifold. Electron-top mass ratio $m_t/m_e \approx 3.4 \times 10^5$ emerges from geometric topology without fine-tuning.}
