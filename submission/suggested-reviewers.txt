REVIEWER 1: Prof. Bobby Acharya
--------------------------------
Institution: King's College London
Email: bobby.acharya@kcl.ac.uk
Expertise: M-theory on G₂ manifolds, string phenomenology, particle physics predictions from string theory

Why suitable: Prof. Acharya is one of the world's leading experts on G₂ compactifications in M-theory. His work on realistic particle physics models from G₂ manifolds (with Witten and others) directly relates to this manuscript's framework. He has extensive experience evaluating phenomenological predictions from M-theory and would be ideal for assessing the particle physics predictions.

REVIEWER 2: Prof. Spiro Karigiannis
------------------------------------
Institution: University of Waterloo
Email: karigiannis@uwaterloo.ca
Expertise: G₂ geometry, special holonomy, calibrated submanifolds, differential geometry

Why suitable: Prof. Karigiannis is a leading mathematician specializing in G₂ geometry and special holonomy manifolds. He would be ideal for evaluating the mathematical rigor of the geometric framework, particularly the claims about Euler characteristics, topology, and torsion-based derivations. His expertise ensures the differential geometry is sound.

REVIEWER 3: Prof. James Halverson
----------------------------------
Institution: Northeastern University
Email: j.halverson@northeastern.edu
Expertise: String compactifications, machine learning in string theory, computational landscape exploration

Why suitable: Prof. Halverson combines deep knowledge of string compactifications with computational approaches. His work on machine learning for string theory landscape exploration is directly relevant to this manuscript's use of TCS G₂ manifold databases. He would be excellent for evaluating the computational methodology and statistical claims about parameter derivation.

REVIEWER 4: Prof. Gordon Kane
------------------------------
Institution: University of Michigan
Email: gkane@umich.edu
Expertise: String phenomenology, moduli stabilization, supersymmetry, collider physics connections

Why suitable: Prof. Kane has extensive experience connecting string theory to observable predictions at colliders. His work on moduli stabilization and realistic string models makes him ideal for evaluating the phenomenological claims, particularly regarding proton decay, KK gravitons, and HL-LHC predictions. He can assess whether the predictions are testable and physically reasonable.

REVIEWER 5: Prof. Lisa Randall
-------------------------------
Institution: Harvard University
Email: randall@physics.harvard.edu
Expertise: Extra dimensions, warped geometry, Randall-Sundrum models, phenomenology of higher-dimensional theories

Why suitable: Prof. Randall is a world leader in extra-dimensional physics and phenomenology. Her expertise in warped extra dimensions and KK graviton phenomenology makes her ideal for evaluating the manuscript's predictions for shared extra dimensions and KK spectrum. She can assess the experimental testability claims and compare to established extra-dimensional frameworks.
