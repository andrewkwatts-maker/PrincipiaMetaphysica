  "abstract": "We analyze the cosmological implications of the multi-sector structure arising from G2 holonomy compactification. The modulation width between sectors is derived from wavefunction overlap geometry, eliminating the last phenomenological parameter. Dark matter abundance emerges as a geometric prediction: Omega_DM/Omega_b ~ 5.4 from temperature asymmetry.",

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The G2 compactification naturally admits multiple sectors related by discrete symmetries. We consider a Z2 mirror sector that couples only gravitationally to the Standard Model sector. The modulation width between sectors emerges from G2 wavefunction overlap geometry: sigma = sqrt(b3/chi_eff) * L_G2, yielding sigma ~ 0.408 with no free parameters. This is the same geometric mechanism that produces Yukawa hierarchies in the fermion sector."
