  "theoretical_significance": "IMPORTANT: The Higgs mass is currently a PHENOMENOLOGICAL INPUT in PM, not a pure geometric prediction. However, it constrains the G₂ modulus Re(T) ≈ 9.865, which appears in other geometric predictions. The true geometric prediction is the doublet-triplet splitting ratio M_T/M_H ~ M_GUT/M_EW ~ 10^13, which arises from TCS discrete torsion and solves a major hierarchy problem in GUT theories. The quartic coupling λ ≈ 0.13 suggests vacuum metastability at m_t ≈ 173 GeV, consistent with observation. Future work: derive m_H from moduli stabilization dynamics.",
